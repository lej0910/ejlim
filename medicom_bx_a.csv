COMPARISON:  Stereotactic biopsy and postbiopsy mammogram of [DATE].

PROCEDURE:

Indications, benefits, risks and alternatives of this procedure were explained to the patient in [NAME]'s language.  Informed consent was freely given.

A lateral to medial approach was selected.  The biopsy sites in the right upper outer quadrant were imaged using a fenestrated compression paddle.  Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion.

A stoplight-shaped marker clip in the approximate 10 o'clock position of right breast at middle depth was localized first, using a 5 cm Kopans needle and hookwire in the usual manner.  A second Kopans needle of 7 cm in length was used to deploy a hook wire adjacent to the dumbbell-shaped marker in the 11:00 posterior position.  This wire was deployed slightly posterior, superior and medial to the marker clip in order to encompass some residual microcalcifications nearby.

The patient tolerated the procedure well and suffered no immediate complications.  She was released to preop in stable condition.

IMPRESSION:

Successful wire localization of 2 biopsy sites in the deep right upper outer quadrant.

An addendum to this report will be generated when specimen radiographs and surgical pathology reports are received.

PATHOLOGY OUTCOME SECTION:  Malignant

PATHOLOGY RESULT SECTION: Surgical pathology results following wire localization and surgical excision have now been received from [ADDRESS].  Accession number was [ID]. 

Specimen radiographs show the dumbbell-shaped biopsy marker clip that was targeted for excision at the posterior right upper outer quadrant. This is designated specimen B on the pathology report. The other surgical specimen (specimen A on the pathology report) shows an intact Kopans wire and several punctate microcalcifications, but the stoplight-shaped marker clip that was targeted is not demonstrated. It may have fallen from the cut surface of the specimen.

Specimen A showed atypical lobular hyperplasia/lobular carcinoma in situ with proliferative fibrocystic changes and calcifications. Margins of surgical resection were benign.

Specimen B showed lobular neoplasia including pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in situ spanning 24 mm of the specimen. There was accompanying intermixed conventional lobular carcinoma in situ. The pleomorphic lobular carcinoma was located less than a millimeter from the anterior inferior margins and 3 mm in the posterior margin. The other margins were wider than 10 mm. The previous biopsy site was identified and proliferative fibrocystic change was noted. Microcalcifications noted with LCIS and proliferative fibrocystic change including sclerosing adenosis. Estrogen receptors were positive. Progesterone receptors were negative.

HISTORY / TARGET:  Enhancing nodule left breast 3 o'clock position

COMPARISON: MRI [DATE]

FINDINGS:

Initially, a diagnostic directed ultrasound of the lateral left breast was performed as a second look to MRI of [DATE].

Ultrasound shows a oval solid 8 mm nodule at the 3 o'clock position, 6 cm from nipple, corresponding in size and position to the enhancing nodule on MRI.  It has features suggestive of potential intramammary lymph node, but given that it enhanced and patient has extensive contralateral malignancy, decision was made to biopsy, clip, and confirm correlation with MRI findings.

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:  Patient presents for ultrasound guided core biopsy of target lesion above. 

Informed consent was obtained.  Procedural pause was performed.  Using standard sterile technique, 1% lidocaine locally, and ultrasound guidance, a 14-gauge coaxial core biopsy needle was directed into the region in question.  Multiple passes were made through the lesion.  

A ribbon marker clip was deployed under ultrasound guidance.   Post procedure mammogram documents clip to be in the expected position and should almost certainly correlate with enhancing nodule on MRI.

Needle was removed and hemostasis was achieved. 


IMPRESSION:

Second Look ultrasound shows an ovoid 8 mm nodule at the 3 o'clock position which should correlate with enhancing nodule on MRI.  This was subsequently biopsied under ultrasound guidance.

The indeterminate calcifications in the 3 to 4 o'clock position of the lower outer quadrant of the left breast were then identified stereotactically and the coordinates were determined.  The area was anesthetized locally using 10 cc of 1% lidocaine.  A skin incision was made superiorly through which a 9-gauge vacuum assisted biopsy device was deployed.  After the needle position was confirmed, multiple specimens were obtained.  The specimen radiograph confirmed the presence of targeted calcifications.  At the end of the procedure, a cork shaped microclip was deployed at the biopsy site.  Attention was then directed to a second grouping of calcifications.  The indeterminate calcifications in the 2 o'clock position of the upper outer quadrant of the left breast were then identified stereotactically and the coordinates were determined.  The area was anesthetized locally using 20 cc of 1% lidocaine.  A skin incision was made superiorly through which a 9-gauge vacuum assisted biopsy device was deployed.

Informed consent was freely given.		A cranio-caudal approach was selected.  The calcifications in question were localized with some difficulty due to the their small size and the density of the surrounding breast tissue.  Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was administered using 1% lidocaine.		A short incision was made in the skin with a #11 blade.  A 9-gauge Suros vacuum-assisted biopsy probe was advanced through the skin incision and deployed in the usual manner without incident. A total of 18  core specimens were retrieved through the biopsy probe.		Magnification specimen radiography revealed several microcalcifications matching the biopsy target.  These were placed in formalin for pathologic analysis.		An MR-compatible marker clip was then deployed through the probe sheath in the usual manner.  Hemostasis was achieved with direct manual compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and suffered no immediate complications.		A diagnostic mammogram obtained after the procedure showed apparent resection of some of the previously seen microcalcifications, with the remainder lying within a centimeter inferior and medial to the biopsy marker clip.		The patient was released with standard postbiopsy care instructions after a brief period of observation and will followup with Dr. [NAME].		IMPRESSION:  		Apparently successful stereotactic biopsy of targeted microcalcifications.

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION: Indications, benefits, risks and alternatives of this procedure were explained to the patient in [NAME]'s language.  Informed consent was freely given.

An oblique caudocranial approach was selected.  The targeted node at the 9 o'clock position 10 cm from the nipple was readily localized.  Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was administered using 1% lidocaine.

A 16 ga. Bard core gun was advanced to the target mass and a total of 3 core specimens were retrieved under continuous sonographic guidance, using completely manual technique because of the proximity of the implant. These were placed in formalin for pathologic analysis.

An MR-compatible, sonographically visible Hydro-Mark marker clip was then deployed within the node in the usual manner.  Hemostasis was achieved with direct manual compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and suffered no immediate complications.

Diagnostic mammography was deferred because of the location of the node and the proximity of the implant.

The patient was released with standard postbiopsy care instructions after a brief period of observation and will follow up with Dr. [NAME].

Informed consent was freely given.		Calcifications were poorly visible by the craniocaudal projection, so a lateral to medial approach was chosen.  The calcifications in question were then readily localized.  Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was administered using 1% lidocaine.		A short incision was made in the skin with a #11 blade.  A 9-gauge Suros vacuum-assisted biopsy probe was advanced through the skin incision and deployed in the usual manner without incident.  8  core specimens were retrieved through the biopsy probe. Magnification specimen radiography during the procedure revealed numerous microcalcifications matching the biopsy target, particularly on specimen G, the last specimen retrieved.  These were placed in formalin for pathologic analysis. An MR-compatible marker clip was then deployed through the probe sheath in the usual manner.		The patient suffered prolonged bleeding after the procedure, which finally ceased after nearly an hour of manual compression.  Brief sonography of the site showed only a small hematoma, however.  Because of the bleeding, postbiopsy mammogram for clip localization was deferred until the patient returns early next week for her postbiopsy follow-up.		The patient was released with postbiopsy care instructions after compression dressing, and will followup with Dr. [NAME].		IMPRESSION:  		1.

COMPARISON:  Mammogram of [DATE].  Stereotactic biopsy and postbiopsy mammogram of [DATE].

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION: 

FINDINGS:

Indications, benefits, risks and alternatives of this procedure were explained to the patient in [NAME]'s language.  Informed consent was freely given.

A medial to lateral approach was selected.  The biopsy clip and residual calcifications were localized using a fenestrated paddle.  The overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion and anesthesia was administered with 1% lidocaine.

A 9 cm Kopans needle was advanced to the marker clip and a hookwire was deployed through the needle without incident.  Post-localization mammograms show the marker clip and adjacent calcifications immediately deep/lateral to the hook of the wire.  A generous lateral surgical margin is appropriate.

There were no immediate complications.  The patient was released to preop in stable condition, with printed copies of the post-procedure mammograms to guide surgical intervention.

IMPRESSION:

Successful preoperative wire localization of the previous biopsy site and residual microcalcifications in the 6-7 o'clock position of left lower inner quadrant at middle depth.

It contains focal intermediate grade ductal carcinoma in situ.  No lymphovascular invasion is identified.    Estrogen and progesterone receptors were both positive.		The reviewing pathologist noted that no lymph node tissue was identified within the specimen, and given the presence of DCIS, it is thought to be a primary carcinoma arising within axillary breast tissue rather than a nodal metastasis.  This is compatible with the imaging appearance, as multiple older mammograms dating back more than a decade have long shown a small nidus of glandular tissue in the same general vicinity of the right axillary tail.		RECOMMENDATION: 	1: Treatment plan Right"

EXAM: LEFT BREAST NEEDLE LOCALIZATION WITH SENTINEL INJECTION WITH ADDITIONAL SITE	ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]		HISTORY:  Recent stereotactic biopsy in the left lower outer quadrant showed ductal carcinoma in situ and atypical lobular hyperplasia.  Wider surgical excision is now being performed, and bracketing technique was requested to help encompass additional faint clusters of microcalcifications nearby.		COMPARISON:  Postbiopsy mammogram of [DATE].		PROCEDURE:		Indications, benefits, risks and alternatives of this procedure were explained to the patient in [NAME]'s language.  Informed consent was freely given.		A lateral to medial approach was selected.  A fenestrated compression paddle was used, and the previous biopsy site was readily localized.  Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was administered with 1% lidocaine.		Two 7 cm Kopans needles were then used to bracket the biopsy marker anteriorly and posteriorly, 3 to 4 cm apart.  After needle tip position was confirmed on orthogonal views, Kopans hook wires were deployed through each needle in the usual manner without incident.  The post-deployment mammogram shows satisfactory localization of the previous biopsy site, and bracketing wires lie close to additional sites of faint punctate microcalcifications that ought to be readily excisable.		A small dose of technetium-99m sulfur colloid was then injected intradermally and subcutaneously in the periareolar soft tissues of the left breast, dividing the dose into 4 injection sites to bracket the nipple on all sides.  Scintigraphic imaging was not requested or performed.  Intraoperative sentinel lymph node localization will be carried out by the attending surgeon using a handheld gamma probe.		The patient tolerated these procedures well and was released to preop in stable.  Printed copies of the post-deployment mammograms were prepared and marked for intraoperative guidance.		An addendum to this report will be generated when specimen radiographs and surgical pathology results are received.		IMPRESSION:		1.	Successful preoperative bracketing localization of the recent malignant biopsy site in the left lower outer quadrant.		2.	Successful periareolar technetium-99m sulfur colloid administration for intraoperative sentinel lymph node localization.		Dosage: 1.2 mCi 99mTc Filtered Sulfur Colloid intradermal		     EXAM: PATHOLOGY ADDENDUM	ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]		PATHOLOGY OUTCOME SECTION:  Malignant		PATHOLOGY RESULT SECTION: Surgical pathology results following wire localization and surgical excision have now been received from [ADDRESS].  Accession number was [ID].		Specimen radiographs acquired after surgical excision showed intact Kopans wires in the primary specimen, bracketing the biopsy marker device.  Both the primary specimen and multiple additional excisional specimens showed multiple clusters of faint microcalcifications, but no discrete mass or architectural distortion.		On pathologic analysis, the primary specimen showed scattered discontinuous microscopic foci of intermediate to high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ with solid architecture and nuclear grade 3.  These averaged less than 1 mm but spanned a distance of 7 cm.  Microcalcifications are seen in association with proliferative fibrocystic change and ductal carcinoma in situ.  DCIS involved the inferior inferior margin and approach to within less than 1 mm at the lateral margin.  The other margins were clear.		A second specimen was excised from the posterior margin of the surgical bed.

ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]

HISTORY:  Invasive lobular carcinoma of the right breast at the 12 o'clock position.

COMPARISON:  [DATE] MRI core biopsy of right breast.

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION: 

TARGET LESION:  See above.  The cylinder clip placed at the time of biopsy migrated at least 2 cm medial to the biopsy site.  A lateral approach was used.

WIRE LOCALIZATION PROCEDURE: The procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with the patient, who understands and agrees. Consent was obtained. Sterile prep and drape. Lidocaine local anesthesia. 
Under mammographic guidance, wire localization was performed from the lateral approach.  A single pass with a 20-gauge Bard needle. Position confirmed and wire deployed. Postprocedure images show the wire at the proper depth for the site of biopsy but substantially short of the cylinder clip that had been placed at the time of biopsy and migrated medially.

Specimen radiograph: The wire is present within the specimen.

INJECTION FOR LYMPHOSCINTIGRAPHY: The procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with the patient, who understands and agrees. Consent was obtained. Sterile prep and drape. Lidocaine local anesthesia. 1 mL containing 1 mCi of technetium 99m labeled sulfur colloid was injected subcutaneously at the 12:00 o'clock periareolar position without complication.

SPECIMEN RADIOGRAPHY:  Specimen radiograph not performed due to migration of the clip at the time of biopsy.

IMPRESSION:

Successful wire localization and subsequent excision for lumpectomy. Injection for lymphoscintigraphy.



     EXAM: Pathology Addendum 
ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]

PATHOLOGY OUTCOME SECTION:  Benign

PATHOLOGY RESULT SECTION:  Pathology results from [ADDRESS] Consultants are now available, accession [ID] , dated [DATE] and shows a papilloma at site A 9 o'clock retroareolar.  Sentinel node is negative.  Right lumpectomy at the 12 o'clock position shows fibrous scar suggestive of remote prior biopsy site changes but no malignancy.      The findings are potentially discordant.

DISCUSSION: While it is possible that the entire invasive lobular carcinoma lesion was removed at the time of core biopsy, it is relatively uncommon.  This raises the possibility of residual tumor.  A repeat wire localization from the medial side of the breast directed at the clip placed at the time of biopsy and extending further lateral may be considered.  Alternatively, after an adequate time to allow for healing (4-6 months) a repeat MRI could be performed to determine whether or not there is any residual enhancing tumor at the 12 o'clock position.  If there is not, no further actions need be taken.  If there is residual enhancement, this could be localized at that time for reexcision.

COMPARISON:  Workup [DATE] 

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION: 

TARGET LESION:  7 mm nodular enhancing lesion deep 12 o'clock position right breast, 9 cm from nipple
 
TECHNIQUE:  Dynamic high-resolution breast MRI was performed pre and post intravenous contrast for biopsy localization purposes.  Gadavist 7ml (NDC [ID]).     

FINDINGS:  After obtaining informed consent, and enhanced MR of the right breast was performed, and re-demonstrates findings described on prior study above.  The target lesion was identified, and using standard sterile technique, MR guidance, and a 9g sheath, an ATEC Suros biopsy device was introduced into the site.  Approximately a dozen core samples were obtained.  Titanium clip was deployed, and sheath was removed.  Hemostasis was achieved with manual compression.

Post-procedure mammogram shows the cylindrical clip to project approximately 2 cm medial to 12 o'clock axis, due to Z axis migration during breast decompression.  Biopsy site was, unequivocally, at 12 o'clock appropriately, and targeted lesion was biopsied, as documented by MR images showing needle position.

There were no complications.

The patient underwent ultrasound-guided biopsy by Dr. [NAME] of the known left breast mass at 2 o'clock.		COMPARISON:	Bilateral diagnostic mammogram and left breast ultrasound [DATE], screening mammogram [DATE].		FINDINGS:	Pertinent imaging was reviewed, confirming the indeterminate calcifications in the left upper, outer breast.  Given that the patient underwent ultrasound-guided biopsy since the most recent imaging, a full lateral was performed to confirm placement of the biopsy clip.		The procedure, including risks, benefits, and alternatives, was discussed with the patient. All questions were answered. Informed written and vertebral consent was obtained.		The skin was then cleaned in the standard sterile fashion. With the patient in craniocaudal compression, from a superior approach, the calcifications were targeted on both scout and stereo views.  Approximately 5 mL of 1% lidocaine was administered to the skin. Using a 10-gauge vacuum-assisted biopsy device, pre and post fire stereotactic guided imaging confirm correct location of the needle. An additional 5 mL of 1% lidocaine was administered through the biopsy device. Multiple specimens were obtained. A biopsy clip was then deployed, confirmed on imaging. Hemostasis was achieved through compression. The skin was then dressed in a clean fashion.		Post biopsy craniocaudal and lateral views demonstrate the top hat-shaped biopsy clip at target location, 3.7 cm superior and 2.7 cm lateral to the hook-shaped biopsy clip placed by Dr. [NAME] at the time of ultrasound-guided biopsy of the known left 2 o'clock breast mass.		The specimen radiograph demonstrates multiple calcifications.		The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication.

Fragment of papillary neoplasm in the 9 o'clock position of right breast at anterior to middle depth.  Ductal carcinoma in situ in the 9 to 10 o'clock position of right breast at middle depth.     		COMPARISON: Ultrasound-guided right breast core biopsy and postbiopsy mammogram of [DATE].  MR guided core biopsy (2 sites) and postbiopsy mammogram of [DATE].		TECHNIQUE:  After informed written consent was obtained, the patient's breast was prepped and cleaned.  A lateral to medial approach was used for all 3 sites, employing a fenestrated compression paddle.  Subcutaneous lidocaine was utilized for local anesthesia.		At the first site in the anterior right breast,  a titanium seed containing I-125 was placed within 1 cm of the breast lesion in the 3:00 retroareolar position (dumbbell shaped marker). The localization needle was withdrawn.		Another I-125 seed was then deployed in the same fashion within 1 cm of the biopsy site at the 9:00 middle to anterior position of right breast (ribbon marker).		A third I-125 seed was then deployed at the site of the biopsy site in the 9-10 o'clock middle position of right breast (cylindrical marker).  This migrated about 1.6 cm medial to the marker during deployment, necessitating a generous lateral margin at surgical excision, but is otherwise on target.		The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complication.		Postprocedure 2 view mammogram confirms accurate seed placement adjacent to the dumbbell-shaped clip in the anterior 3:00 retroareolar position and adjoining the ribbon clip in the 9:00 middle to anterior position of right breast.  The third seed that was placed at the most posterior biopsy site, in the 9-10 o'clock middle position next to the cylindrical marker, lies about 1.6 cm immediately medial to the biopsy site.

EXAM: US BREAST LT CYST ASPIRATION  2 SITES, US BREAST CORE BX RT 1 SITE	ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]		HISTORY:  Complex cystic lesions in the 12:00 and 2:30 position of left breast.  Palpable nodularity in the mastectomy scar in the upper right breast.		COMPARISON:  Left breast ultrasound and mammogram of [DATE].		PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION: Indications, benefits, risks and alternatives of this procedure were explained to the patient in [NAME]'s language.  Informed consent was freely given.		On the left, a lateral to medial approach was selected.  The complex cyst at the 2:30 position, 5 cm from the nipple, was targeted first.  Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was administered using 1% lidocaine.  The cyst lumen was entered first with a 21-gauge hypodermic needle, but no luminal contents could be aspirated.  A second pass was made with an 18-gauge hypodermic needle, and the cyst was successfully drained in its entirety, leaving no solid component.  The cyst fluid is of viscous, characteristically benign yellowish-tan color, and was discarded.		Using identical technique, the complex cyst at the 12 o'clock position of left breast 3 cm from the nipple was then entered in a single pass with a 20-gauge hypodermic needle.  The yellowish-tan cyst fluid here is not as viscous as the first cyst that was drained, and it was successfully aspirated in its entirety, leaving no solid component.  Again, the characteristically benign cyst fluid was discarded.		The right breast has undergone mastectomy.  The palpable nodularity correlates with suspected slightly hyperechoic scar that extends to the skin surface.  This lies at the apex of a curvilinear skin scar in the 12 o'clock position of the surgical bed.  The subcutaneous component was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine and targeted for core biopsy by a lateral to medial approach.		A 16 ga. Bard core gun was placed adjacent to the target, and a total of 3 core specimens were retrieved under continuous sonographic guidance. These were placed in formalin for pathologic analysis.		As this post-mastectomy patient has essentially no remaining native breast tissue amenable to mammography, a marker clip was not placed.  Hemostasis was achieved with direct manual compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and suffered no immediate complications.		The patient was released with standard postbiopsy care instructions after a brief period of observation and will follow up with Dr. [NAME] and Dr. [NAME], who ordered these procedures.		IMPRESSION:  		1.	Successful ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of 2 complex cysts in the 12:00 and 2:30 o'clock positions of the left breast.  The cysts were completely aspirated, with no remaining solid component.  The cyst fluid was of characteristically benign appearance and was therefore discarded.		2.	Successful ultrasound-guided core biopsy of a palpable nodularity at the 12 o'clock position of right mastectomy bed.  This is believed to be scar tissue rather than recurrent neoplasm.  No marker clip was left at the site.

ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]

HISTORY:  Patient presents for ultrasound-guided biopsy of left breast mass and left axillary abnormal lymph node.

COMPARISON:  Left breast ultrasound of same day, breast MRI [DATE], outside bilateral diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound [DATE]

FINDINGS:

Pertinent imaging was reviewed, confirming the target location of the left breast mass at 10 o'clock, 7 cm from the nipple as well as the left axilla.

The procedure, including risks, benefits, alternatives, was discussed with the patient. All questions were answered. Informed written and vertebral consent was obtained.

First the left breast mass at 7 o'clock was targeted.  The area in question was again imaged under ultrasound. The skin was then dressed and draped in the standard sterile fashion. Approximately 5 mL of 1% lidocaine was administered into the skin. A small incision was made. Under ultrasound guidance, a 14-gauge coaxial Bard biopsy device was inserted into the breast. Multiple specimens were obtained. Under ultrasound guidance, a biopsy clip was then placed at the site. Hemostasis was achieved through compression. The skin was dressed in a clean fashion.

Next the left axilla was targeted in the same fashion.  Also under ultrasound guidance, a biopsy clip was then deployed.

Post biopsy mammograms could not demonstrate the left breast mass despite multiple attempts, given its posterior and medial location.  Also the clip in the abnormal axillary lymph node could also not be visualized.

The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication. She was given postbiopsy care instructions. She left the department in stable condition.

IMPRESSION:

Technically successful ultrasound-guided biopsy of the left breast mass at 7 o'clock as well as the abnormal left axillary lymph node with biopsy clips at target. An addendum to this report will be issued once pathology results are available.     EXAM: Pathology Addendum

EXAM: MRI RIGHT BREAST VACUUM ASSISTED BIOPSY WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST - 2 SITES	ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]		HISTORY: [AGE]-year-old woman recently diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ in the 8 to 9:00 position of the right breast presents for MRI guided core needle biopsy of enhancement in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast to establish disease extent.		COMPARISON:  Breast MRI dated [DATE], mammograms dated [DATE], [DATE], [DATE], [DATE], [DATE] and [DATE] 		FINDINGS: Prior to the procedure, the patient's mammograms dating back to [DATE] were reviewed. The superficial nodule noted on the MRI in the 10:00 position of the right breast corresponds to a nodule which is evident mammographically. This has been stable since at least the [DATE] exam and has an imaging appearance most suggestive of an intramammary lymph node. On the MRI localization sequences performed prior to the biopsy, the nodule was noted adjacent to several vessels. Again, the MRI imaging features were that of a benign intramammary lymph node. Given the benign imaging features suggestive of an intramammary lymph node and the stability overtime,, I decided not to biopsy the nodule.		TECHNIQUE:  Dynamic high-resolution breast MRI was performed pre and post intravenous contrast for biopsy localization purposes.  Gadavist 6 ml.     		PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:  After informed written consent was obtained, the patient was placed in a prone position and multiplanar images in various sequences were acquired through the right breast.  The right breast was then prepped and cleaned in a sterile fashion. The enhancement in the posterior aspect of the 9 to 10:00 position was then identified and the coordinates were determined.  The area was anesthetized locally using 10 cc of 1% lidocaine.  A skin incision was made laterally through which an introducer was placed.  After the position was confirmed, multiple specimens were obtained using a 9-gauge vacuum assisted biopsy device.  At the end of the procedure, a cork shaped microclip was deployed at the biopsy site. Attention was then directed to the more anterior aspect of the enhancement. The enhancement in the 9:00 position of the right breast anteriorly was then identified and the coordinates were determined.  The area was anesthetized locally using 10 cc of 1% lidocaine.  A skin incision was made laterally through which an introducer was placed.  After the position was confirmed, multiple specimens were obtained using a 9-gauge vacuum assisted biopsy device.  At the end of the procedure, an hourglass shaped microclip was deployed at the biopsy site.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complication.  The specimens were labeled and sent to [ADDRESS] for analysis. 		Postprocedure mammographic views of the right breast confirm the presence of the microclip in the expected locations. The 2 microclip from the MRI guided core needle biopsy are located superior and posterior to the biopsy site demonstrating DCIS.		IMPRESSION: 		MRI guided core needle biopsy of areas of enhancement in the 9:00 and 9-10 o'clock positions of the right breast.		When the pathology report becomes available, an addendum will be made.		   			     EXAM: Pathology Addendum 	ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]		PATHOLOGY OUTCOME SECTION:  Malignant		PATHOLOGY RESULT SECTION:  The pathology report for the biopsy of the enhancement posteriorly in the 9 to 10 o'clock position of the right breast reads ""ductal carcinoma in situ, intermediate grade, cribriform and micropapillary type with associated microcalcifications.  Invasive carcinoma is not present.""  The pathology report for the biopsy of the enhancement in the 9 o'clock position of the right breast anteriorly reads ""ductal carcinoma in situ, intermediate grade, cribriform, solid, and micropapillary types with associated microcalcifications.  Intraductal papilloma with associated microcalcifications; invasive carcinoma is not present.""  This confirms multicentric disease involving the upper outer and lower outer quadrant of the right breast.  The area of involvement measures at least 5.9 x 2.9 x 3.2 cm based on the location of the microclip.  Given the enhancement on the MRI, the area of involvement is likely even greater.  The patient is seen a surgeon in consultation.		RECOMMENDATION: 	1: Treatment plan Right"

This appears to be the same as an enhancing nodule in the deep left upper outer quadrant on breast MR.		COMPARISON:  Breast MR of [DATE].  Diagnostic mammogram and left breast ultrasound from [DATE], as well as screening mammograms from [DATE], performed at [ADDRESS].		PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION: Indications, benefits, risks and alternatives of this procedure were explained to the patient in [NAME]'s language.  Informed consent was freely given.		A lateral to medial approach was selected.  The targeted mass was readily localized, lying in the 1-2 o'clock position of the deep upper outer quadrant of left breast, 5 cm from the nipple.  It measures approximately 0.7 cm maximal diameter on ultrasound, with indistinct and rather angular margins and some moderate central acoustic shadowing.  Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was administered using 1% lidocaine.		A 16 ga. Bard Marquis core gun was placed adjacent to the target mass and a total of 4 core specimens were retrieved under continuous sonographic guidance. These were placed in formalin for pathologic analysis.		An MR-compatible ribbon-shaped Bard marker clip was then deployed through the guide needle in the usual manner.  There was mild but prolonged bleeding, but hemostasis was achieved after about 10 minutes of direct manual compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and suffered no other immediate complications.		A diagnostic mammogram obtained after the procedure showed the marker clip in the deep left upper outer quadrant, corresponding well to the area of concern on the previous mammograms and MR scan.  The targeted nodule is now obscured by new heterogeneous density in the surrounding soft tissues, probably a combination of lidocaine and infiltrating hematoma.		The patient was released with standard postbiopsy care instructions after a brief period of observation and will follow up with her physician in [ADDRESS].

ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]

HISTORY: Patient presents for MR guided biopsy of the third site in the left breast after biopsy at 10 o'clock demonstrated invasive ductal carcinoma and at 12 o'clock demonstrated papilloma.

COMPARISON:  Left breast MR guided biopsy [DATE], breast MRI [DATE], screening mammograms [DATE] 

TECHNIQUE:  Dynamic high-resolution breast MRI was performed pre and post intravenous contrast for biopsy localization purposes.  Gadavist 6.5ml (NDC [ID]) .  Lab specimen sent to [ADDRESS]

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:  

After informed written consent was obtained, the patient was placed in a prone position and multiplanar images in various sequences were acquired through the left breast.  The left breast was then prepped and cleaned in a sterile fashion.  The enhancement in the upper, inner quadrant, posterior depth, of the left breast was then identified and the coordinates were determined.  The area was anesthetized locally using 10 cc of 1% lidocaine.  A skin incision was made medially through which an introducer was placed.  After the position was confirmed, multiple specimens were obtained using a 9-gauge vacuum assisted biopsy device.  At the end of the procedure, an hourglass microclip was deployed at the biopsy site.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complication.  The specimens were labeled and sent to [ADDRESS] for analysis. 

Postprocedure mammogram demonstrates the biopsy clip only on craniocaudal view.  Today's new biopsy clip is hourglass in shape and is far medial and posterior.  Note is made of the barrel-shaped biopsy clip at 10 o'clock, middle depth, at the site of invasive ductal carcinoma, as well as the most anterior hourglass biopsy clip in the retroareolar breast at the site of papilloma.

IMPRESSION: 

Technically successful MR guided biopsy of the area enhancement in the left upper, inner breast, 10-11 o'clock, posterior depth.  An addendum to this report will be issued once pathology results are available.

     NOTE:

This case was discussed at length with Dr. [NAME] on [DATE] at about 1750 hours.

There are 3 sites of noteworthy focal enhancement that were noted in the left breast on the original diagnostic breast MR of [DATE].  These are at the 12:00 o'clock central/anterior position, seen on image 50 of series 10007; the 10:00 o'clock middle position, seen on image 44/10007; and the deep 11:00 o'clock position on image 38/10007.

The postbiopsy mammogram shows marker clips that correlate with the 12:00 and 11:00 lesions, the latter of which appears to correspond to the microcalcifications.

The lesion seen on MR at the 10 o'clock position at middle depth does not appear to have been sampled.  Therefore, second-look ultrasound would be advised, with biopsy of any visible abnormality.  If there is no sonographic abnormality that corresponds to this 1.2 cm area of focally prominent but ill-defined enhancement on MR, then at a minimum, short interval MR follow-up would be advised.  However, in this patient with known malignancy, a third MR-guided biopsy must also be considered in this circumstance."

EXAM: ULTRASOUND GUIDED BIOPSY RIGHT BREAST
ACCESSION: [ID]

HISTORY:  [AGE]-year-old woman who had a right mastectomy presents for ultrasound guided core needle biopsy of an enlarged right axillary lymph node.

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:  After informed written consent was obtained, the patient's right axilla was prepped and cleaned in a sterile fashion.  The enlarged right axillary lymph node was identified sonographically.  The area was anesthetized locally using 8 cc of 2 % lidocaine.  A skin incision was made laterally through which an introducer was placed and 2  samples were obtained using a 20-gauge core needle biopsy device under ultrasound guidance.  Due to the close proximity of the lymph node to the axillary vessels, only 2 samples were obtained.  One of the samples were obtained, one of which was sent for flow cytometry.  A clip was not deployed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complication.

EXAM: STEREOTACTIC-GUIDED VACUUM-ASSISTED LEFT BREAST BIOPSY, LIMITED LEFT BREAST ULTRASOUND	ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]		HISTORY:  [AGE]-year-old woman presents for stereotactic guided core needle biopsy of distortion in the lower outer quadrant of the left breast.		ULTRASOUND FINDINGS:		Prior to the procedure, ultrasound of the outer left breast was performed.  The subtle hypoechoic nodule in the 1 o'clock position of the left breast, 1 cm from the nipple which was seen on ultrasound dated [DATE] was again seen. However, in review of the images and real-time scanning, I do not believe that this correlates with the area of distortion on the mammogram.  Therefore, I decided to proceed with a stereotactic guided core needle biopsy.		PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:  After informed written consent was obtained, the patient was placed in a prone position and her left breast was prepped and cleaned in a sterile fashion.  The distortion in the 4 o'clock position of the left breast were then identified stereotactically and the coordinates were determined.  The area was anesthetized locally using 10 cc of 1% lidocaine.  A skin incision was made superiorly through which a 9-gauge vacuum assisted biopsy device was deployed.  After the needle position was confirmed, multiple specimens were obtained.  At the end of the procedure, a top-shaped microclip was deployed at the biopsy site.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complication.  The specimens were labeled and sent to [ADDRESS] for analysis. 		Postprocedure mammographic views of the left breast confirmed the presence of the microclip in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast,  Superficial to the distortion, likely due to accordion effect.  Careful correlation with the pathology results will be needed.		IMPRESSION:		Stereotactic-guided core needle biopsy of distortion in the lower outer quadrant of the  left breast.

EXAM: US BREAST LT WIRE LOCALIZATION, NM LYMPHOSCINTIGRAPHY INJECTION, MAMM POST PROCEDURE CLIP PLACEMENT LT
ACCESSION: [ID], [ID], [ID]

HISTORY:  Invasive lobular carcinoma, deep left lower outer quadrant

COMPARISON:  Ultrasound-guided core biopsy from [DATE]

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION: Indications, benefits, risks and alternatives of this procedure were explained to the patient in [NAME]'s language.  Informed consent was freely given.

Ultrasound-guided rather than mammographically guided wire localization is being performed because of the proximity of the malignancy to the patient's mammoplasty implant.  The lesion has a somewhat bilobed appearance in the parasagittal plane, so a cranio-caudal approach was selected in order to encompass both lobulations of the lesion.  The target mass was readily localized sonographically.  Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was administered using 1% lidocaine.

A 5 cm Kopans needle was advanced through both lobulations of the hypoechoic, irregular, shadowing target mass under continuous sonographic guidance, with care to avoid the mammoplasty implants.  A hook wire was then deployed through the needle, with its tip immediately inferior to the more caudal of the 2 lobulations.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and suffered no immediate complications.

A diagnostic mammogram obtained after the procedure was limited by attenuation from the patient's mammoplasty implants.  The localization wire appears to traverse an area of indistinct focal asymmetry and architectural distortion that would be compatible with the sonographic appearance.

The patient was then administered 1 mCi of technetium-99m sulfur colloid in the periareolar left breast, dividing the dose into 4 intradermal/subcutaneous injection sites to bracket the nipple on all sides.  Scintigraphic imaging was not requested or performed.  Intraoperative sentinel lymph node localization will be carried out by the attending surgeon using a handheld gamma probe.

The patient was released to preop in stable condition.

IMPRESSION:  

1.	Successful wire localization of a shadowing mass in the left lower outer quadrant.

2.	Successful left periareolar technetium-99m sulfur colloid injection for intraoperative sentinel lymph node localization.

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:

After informed written consent was obtained, the patient's right breast was prepped and cleaned in a sterile fashion.  After the the-shaped microclip in the 1 o'clock position was identified mammographically, the coordinates were determined.  The area was anesthetized locally with 5 cc of 1% lidocaine.  A 5 cm Kopans localization needle was then advanced adjacent to the microclip via a medial approach.  After the needle position was confirmed,     the wire was deployed and secured in place.  Attention was then directed to the benign biopsy site in the 6 o'clock position.  After the ribbon-shaped microclip was identified mammographically, the coordinates were determined.  The area was anesthetized locally with 5 cc of 1% lidocaine.  A 9 cm Kopans localization needle was then advanced adjacent to the ribbon-shaped microclip via a medial approach.  After the needle position was confirmed,     the wire was deployed and secured in place.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complication.

Postprocedure orthogonal views of the right breast confirm the presence of the localization wire is adjacent to the the-shaped and a ribbon-shaped microclips.  The films were labeled and sent to the [ADDRESS] with the patient.

The right periareolar region was then prepped and cleaned in a sterile fashion. 1 mCi of technetium 99M sulfur colloid was then injected intradermally in the right periareolar region. The needle was directed to the 12:00, 3:00, 6:00 and 9:00 positions. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complication.

2 specimen radiographs were obtained.  The specimen radiographs demonstrate both clips and both wires.  These results were discussed with Dr. [NAME] in the [ADDRESS] at the time the exam.

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION: 

TECHNIQUE:  Dynamic high-resolution breast MRI was performed pre and post intravenous contrast for biopsy localization purposes.  Gadavist 7.5 ml. 

FINDINGS: 

Written informed consent was obtained for MRI guided biopsy.  The enhancing nodule is again seen in the posterior left central breast.  This was approached from the lateral direction.  The skin was cleansed in the usual sterile fashion.  Subcutaneous lidocaine was utilized for local anesthesia.  A small skin nick was made with a scalpel.

Utilizing grid localization, a 9-gauge trocar was advanced to the area of enhancement.  Axial images were obtained to confirm positioning.  The trocar is in appropriate position.

Utilizing vacuum assistance, multiple specimens were obtained.  A bar-shaped clip was deployed.  The trocar was removed and hemostasis was obtained.

Postbiopsy mammogram demonstrates that the clip appears slightly lateral to the expected biopsy site. This lies 3 cm superior to the ribbon clip at the site of the known malignancy.

A third nodule in the left upper outer quadrant at middle to posterior depth was not seen on the second look ultrasound, and is now undergoing MR guided biopsy.		COMPARISON:  Breast MR of [DATE].		TECHNIQUE:  Dynamic high-resolution breast MRI was performed pre and post intravenous contrast for biopsy localization purposes.  Gadavist 6 ml.     		PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:		Indications, benefits, risks and alternatives of this procedure were explained to the patient in [NAME]'s language.  Informed consent was freely given.		Patient was premedicated with methylprednisolone and Benadryl because of a previous episode of hives after gadolinium was administered.		A lateral to medial approach was selected. Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion.   MR imaging was performed with the breast held in compression with a gridded compression paddle. The targeted lesion in the left upper outer quadrant was readily localized.  		Local anesthesia was administered using 1% lidocaine. A short incision was made in the skin with a #11 blade. A guide sheath was applied over a trocar. A stylet was then placed in the guide sheath, and MR images were repeated to confirm accurate placement. 		A handheld 9 gauge Suros biopsy probe was then advanced through the guide sheath, and a total of  12  core specimens were retrieved under vacuum assist. These were placed in formalin for pathologic analysis.		An MR-compatible cylindrical marker device was then deployed through the guide sheath in the usual manner.  		Hemostasis was achieved with direct manual compression, although bleeding was rather prolonged.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and suffered no allergic reaction or other immediate complications.		A diagnostic mammogram obtained after the procedure showed the marker clip at the expected location of the targeted lesion in the left upper outer quadrant.		The patient was released with standard postbiopsy care instructions after a brief period of observation and will follow up with Dr. [NAME]		IMPRESSION:  		Successful MR-guided biopsy of enhancing nodule in left upper outer quadrant.

HISTORY:  [AGE]-year-old woman presents for stereotactic guided core needle biopsy of indeterminate calcifications in the 2 o'clock position, upper outer quadrant, of the left breast.

PROCEDURE:  After informed written consent was obtained, the patient was placed in a prone position and her left breast was prepped and cleaned in a sterile fashion.  The indeterminate calcifications in the 2 o'clock position of the left breast were then identified stereotactically and the coordinates were determined.  The area was anesthetized locally using 10 cc of 1% lidocaine.  A skin incision was made lateral through which a 9-gauge vacuum assisted biopsy device was deployed.  After the needle position was confirmed, multiple specimens were obtained.  The specimen radiograph confirmed the presence of targeted calcifications.  At the end of the procedure, a microclip was deployed at the biopsy site.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complication.  The specimens were labeled and sent to [ADDRESS] for analysis. 

Postprocedure mammographic views of the left breast confirmed the presence of the microclip in the expected location.

EXAM: ULTRASOUND-GUIDED RIGHT BREAST CORE BIOPSY (TWO SITES) AND LIMITED RIGHT BREAST ULTRASOUND
ACCESSION: [ID], [ID], [ID]

HISTORY:  Suspicious lesion in the right upper outer quadrant and indeterminant nodule in the right outer breast.

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:

Written informed consent was obtained for ultrasound-guided right breast core biopsies.  
 
Initial imaging demonstrates a 5 mm partially cystic nodular region at 9:00 3 cm from the nipple. This appears to correspond to the nodule seen mammographically. Therefore, ultrasound-guided core biopsy was performed instead of stereotactic biopsy.

The small nodule at 9:00 was approached from the lateral direction.  Skin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Subcutaneous lidocaine was utilized for local anesthesia.  A small skin nick was made with a scalpel.  Under sonographic-guidance, a 16 gauge core biopsy needle was advanced to the lesion.  3 passes were made.  Specimens were deemed adequate.  A ribbon clip was deployed. Needle was removed and hemostasis was obtained.  

The suspicious lesion at 10:00 was approached from the same incision. Under sonographic-guidance, a 16 gauge core biopsy needle was advanced to the lesion.  3 passes were made.  Specimens were deemed adequate.  A winged clip was deployed.  Needle was removed and hemostasis was obtained. 

Postbiopsy mammogram demonstrates that the clips appear in appropriate position.

The patient left the department in satisfactory condition.

Recent MR showed indeterminate non-mass enhancement in the vicinity of the surgical bed.		COMPARISON:  Breast MR, Southwest Medical Imaging Ltd., [DATE].		TECHNIQUE:  Dynamic high-resolution breast MRI was performed pre and post intravenous contrast for biopsy localization purposes.  Gadavist 8.5 ml.  Two specimens sent to [ADDRESS]		PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:		Indications, benefits, risks and alternatives of this procedure were explained to the patient in [NAME]'s language.  Informed consent was freely given.		A lateral to medial approach was selected. Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion.   MR imaging was performed with the breast held in compression with a gridded compression paddle. There are 2 targets for biopsy in the left lower outer quadrant, one more posterior and lateral and the other closer to the center of the breast at middle depth.		The more anterior and central of the 2 lower outer quadrant lesions was designated Site 1. The more posterior and lateral of the 2 sites was designated Site 2. Local anesthesia was administered at both sites using 1% lidocaine. A short incision was made in the skin at each site with a #11 blade. A guide sheath was applied over a trocar at each of the 2 sites, followed by placement of a stylet in each sheath, and MR images were repeated to confirm accurate placement. 		A handheld 9 gauge Suros biopsy probe was then advanced through the guide sheath at Site 1, and a total of  12  core specimens were retrieved under vacuum assist. These were placed in formalin for pathologic analysis. Identical technique was used with a separate 9 gauge biopsy probe at Site 2. Again, 12 specimens were retrieved and placed in a separate formalin vial for pathologic analysis.		An MR compatible marker clip was then deployed at each site through the guide sheath in the usual manner. At Site 1, a cylindrical clip was used, while at Site 2, a dumbbell shaped clip was used.		Hemostasis was achieved with direct manual compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and suffered no immediate complications.		A diagnostic mammogram obtained after the procedure showed both markers in the inferior left breast slightly inferior to the surgical bed. The cylindrical marker device at site 1 is at the 6 to 7 o'clock position at middle depth, while the dumbbell-shaped marker at site 2 is at the 5 to 6 o'clock position at posterior depth. In both cases it appears that the markers remained at the most medial aspects of the biopsy cavities following deployment, as the 2 target sites seen on MR are in the 4 to 5 o'clock position at middle and posterior depth. Therefore, if wider surgical excision is to be performed, generous margins of excision medial to the marker devices would be advised.		The patient was released with standard postbiopsy care instructions after a brief period of observation and will follow up with Dr. [NAME].		IMPRESSION:  		Successful MR-guided biopsies at 2 sites in the left lower outer quadrant.  A marker clip was left at each site, and in each case, has migrated to the deepest and most medial aspect of the corresponding biopsy cavity after deployment. If wider excision is to be performed in future, generous surgical margins of excision lateral to the markers would be appropriate.		An addendum to this report will be generated when biopsy results are received.	     EXAM: Pathology Addendum 	ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]		PATHOLOGY OUTCOME SECTION:  Malignant		PATHOLOGY RESULT SECTION:  		MR guided biopsy performed by Dr. [NAME] of the left breast at 4-5:00, middle and posterior, demonstrates infiltrating mucinous carcinoma.

EXAM: US BREAST CORE BX RT 1 SITE, MAMM POST PROCEDURE CLIP PLACEMENT RT	ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]		HISTORY:  Indistinct hypoechoic lesion in the 10:00 middle position of right breast, possibly correlating with vague focal asymmetry in the upper outer quadrant on mammography.		COMPARISON:  Right breast ultrasound performed here on [DATE]. Diagnostic mammogram of right breast dated [DATE] and screening mammograms of [DATE] (performed at Assured Imaging). Diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound of right breast performed here on [DATE]. Screening mammograms performed here on [DATE].		PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION: Indications, benefits, risks and alternatives of this procedure were explained to the patient in [NAME]'s language.  Informed consent was freely given.		An oblique lateral to medial approach was selected.  The target lesion was successfully localized, but is not as distinct as it was on the recent diagnostic ultrasound.  Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was administered using 1% lidocaine.		A 14 ga. Bard core gun was placed adjacent to the target lesion and a total of 3 core specimens were retrieved under continuous sonographic guidance. These were placed in formalin for pathologic analysis.		An MR-compatible ribbon-shaped Bard marker clip was then deployed through the guide needle in the usual manner.  Hemostasis was achieved with direct manual compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and suffered no immediate complications.		A diagnostic mammogram obtained after the procedure showed the marker clip in the 10-11 o'clock position of right breast at middle depth, amidst dense heterogeneous breast tissue with no discrete mass. It lies some 3 cm anterior and medial to the indistinct focal asymmetry seen on the outside mammograms performed earlier this year, as well as the microcalcifications that lay nearby, and it appears that the mammographic and sonographic abnormalities are distinct from each other.		The patient was released with standard postbiopsy care instructions after a brief period of observation and will follow up with Dr. [NAME].		IMPRESSION:  		1.	Successful ultrasound-guided biopsy of an ill-defined hypoechoic lesion in the right upper outer quadrant that was seen on recent sonography.  A marker clip was left at the site.  An addendum to this report will be generated when biopsy results are received.	2.	The mammographic and sonographic abnormalities identified on the recent diagnostic imaging workup appear to be distinct and separate lesions. An additional stereotactically-guided biopsy more posteriorly and laterally in the right upper outer quadrant should be strongly considered, although this can be deferred until we have the current biopsy results in hand.	     EXAM: PATHOLOGY ADDENDUM	ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]		PATHOLOGY OUTCOME SECTION:  Benign		PATHOLOGY RESULT SECTION: Ultrasound-guided core biopsy results have now been received from [ADDRESS].

Imaging and pathology findings are concordant.		As noted previously, the sonographic and mammographic abnormalities that are being worked up appear to be 2 distinct lesions.  Stereotactic biopsy of the separate asymmetric density should be considered.  If this is not performed, then at a minimum, MR imaging would be helpful for better characterization.		A short interval follow-up mammogram and ultrasound of the current biopsy site in about 6 months would also be advisable.		RECOMMENDATION: 	1: Needle biopsy Right"

PATHOLOGY OUTCOME SECTION:  Malignant

PATHOLOGY RESULT SECTION:  The pathology report for the biopsy of the lesion in the 3:00 position of the left breast reads ""atypical papilloma (intraductal papilloma with atypical ductal hyperplasia)."" The pathology report for the biopsy of the lesion in the 2:00 position of the left breast reads ""high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ, solid architecture (nuclear grade 3 with necrosis); atypical papilloma."" Given the presence of the atypia and DCIS, surgical excision is recommended. Although the biopsy clips are separated by a distance of about 2.2 cm on the mammogram, there is more extensive underlying suspicious enhancement on the breast MRI spanning an area measuring at least 6 cm (AP) by 4 cm (craniocaudal) by 5 cm (transverse). The enhancement involves the majority of the upper outer quadrant, extending slightly into the lower outer and upper inner quadrants as well. These results were discussed with Dr. [NAME] on [DATE] at 11:00 AM.

New subcentimeter focal non-mass enhancement on MR in the 5 to 6 o'clock position of left breast at middle depth.		COMPARISON:  MR of [DATE]		TECHNIQUE:  Dynamic high-resolution breast MRI was performed pre and post intravenous contrast for biopsy localization purposes.  Gadavist 7 ml.     		PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:		Indications, benefits, risks and alternatives of this procedure were explained to the patient in [NAME]'s language.  Informed consent was freely given.		A lateral to medial approach was selected. Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion.   MR imaging was performed with the breast held in compression with a gridded compression paddle. The targeted lesion was readily localized.  		Local anesthesia was administered using 1% lidocaine. A short incision was made in the skin with a #11 blade. A guide sheath was applied over a trocar. A stylet was then placed in the guide sheath, and MR images were repeated to confirm accurate placement. 		A handheld 9 gauge Suros biopsy probe was then advanced through the guide sheath, and a total of  12  core specimens were retrieved under vacuum assist. These were placed in formalin for pathologic analysis.		An MR compatible marker clip was then deployed through the guide sheath in the usual manner.  		Hemostasis was achieved with direct manual compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and suffered no immediate complications.		A diagnostic mammogram obtained after the procedure showed the marker clip in the 6:00 middle position of left breast, 1-2 cm medial to the expected location of the enhancing lesion seen on MR, probably in the deeper aspect of the biopsy cavity.  There is no associated mass, nonsurgical distortion or suspicious microcalcification.		The patient was released with standard postbiopsy care instructions after a brief period of observation and will follow up with Dr. [NAME].		IMPRESSION:  		Apparently successful MR-guided biopsy of enhancing lesion in left lower outer quadrant.  A marker clip was left at the site, and lies 1-2 cm medial to the expected location of the abnormal focus of enhancement, so a generous lateral margin is suggested if wider surgical excision is necessary in future.		An addendum to this report will be generated when biopsy results are received.	     EXAM: PATHOLOGY ADDENDUM	ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]		PATHOLOGY OUTCOME SECTION:  Benign		PATHOLOGY RESULT SECTION: MR guided biopsy results have now been received from [ADDRESS].

WITH DIAGNOSTIC MAMMOGRAM
ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]

HISTORY: Recent MR scan showed a small enhancing nodule with early washout kinetics in the 9 to 10 o'clock position of left breast at middle depth.  Second look ultrasound did not show any corresponding abnormality.

COMPARISON:  Screening mammograms of [DATE].  Diagnostic mammogram of [DATE].  Stereotactic left breast biopsy and postbiopsy mammogram of [DATE].  Breast MR of [DATE].  Left breast ultrasound of [DATE].

TECHNIQUE:  Dynamic high-resolution breast MRI was performed pre and post intravenous contrast for biopsy localization purposes.  Gadavist 7 ml (NDC [ID]).     

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:

Indications, benefits, risks and alternatives of this procedure were explained to the patient in [NAME]'s language.  Informed consent was freely given.

A medial to lateral approach was selected. Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion.   MR imaging was performed with the breast held in compression with a gridded compression paddle. The targeted lesion was readily localized.  

Local anesthesia was administered using 1% lidocaine. A short incision was made in the skin with a #11 blade. A guide sheath was applied over a trocar. A stylet was then placed in the guide sheath, and MR images were repeated to confirm accurate placement.  

A handheld 9 gauge Suros biopsy probe was then advanced through the guide sheath, and a total of  12  core specimens were retrieved under vacuum assist. These were placed in formalin for pathologic analysis.

An MR compatible marker clip was then deployed through the guide sheath in the usual manner.  

Hemostasis was achieved with direct manual compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and suffered no immediate complications.

A diagnostic mammogram obtained after the procedure showed the biopsy cavity centered at the 9-10 o'clock position of the left breast at middle depth, corresponding well to the focus of abnormal enhancement on breast MRI.  However, the marker clip migrated quite far (approximately 5-6 cm) lateral to the target site due to the accordion effect when compression was released.  This should be taken into account if wider surgical excision is necessary.

The patient was released with standard postbiopsy care instructions after a brief period of observation and will follow up with Dr. [NAME].

IMPRESSION:  

Seemingly successful MR-guided biopsy of enhancing nodule in the left upper inner quadrant.  A marker clip was deployed at the site, but migrated laterally due to the so-called accordion effect.  If wider surgical excision is necessary in future, the plainly visible biopsy site should be localized, rather than the marker clip per se.

The indeterminate calcifications in the 10 o'clock position  of the right breast were then identified stereotactically and the coordinates were determined.  The area was anesthetized locally using 10 cc of 1% lidocaine.  A skin incision was made lateral through which a 9-gauge vacuum assisted biopsy device was deployed.  After the needle position was confirmed, multiple specimens were obtained.  The specimen radiograph confirmed the presence of targeted calcifications.  At the end of the procedure, a microclip was deployed at the biopsy site.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complication.  The specimens were labeled and sent to [ADDRESS] for analysis. 		Postprocedure mammographic views of the right breast confirmed the presence of the microclip in the expected location.  		IMPRESSION:		Stereotactic-guided core needle biopsy of indeterminate calcifications in the 10 o'clock position, upper outer quadrant, of the right breast.

Irregular 1.2 cm focus of enhancement in the 11-12 o'clock anterior position of left breast		COMPARISON:  Diagnostic breast MR dated [DATE].		TECHNIQUE:  Dynamic high-resolution breast MRI was performed pre and post intravenous contrast for biopsy localization purposes.  Gadavist 10 ml.  I-STAT CR=1.2		PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:		Indications, benefits, risks and alternatives of this procedure were explained to the patient in [NAME]'s language.  Informed consent was freely given.		A medial to lateral approach was selected. Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion.   MR imaging was performed with the breast held in compression with a gridded compression paddle. The targeted lesion was readily localized.  		Local anesthesia was administered using 1% lidocaine. A short incision was made in the skin with a #11 blade. A guide sheath was applied over a trocar. A stylet was then placed in the guide sheath, and MR images were repeated to confirm accurate placement. 		A handheld 9 gauge petite Suros biopsy probe was then advanced through the guide sheath, and a total of  14  core specimens were retrieved under vacuum assist. These were placed in formalin for pathologic analysis.		An MR compatible cylindrical marker clip was then deployed through the guide sheath in the usual manner.  		Hemostasis was achieved with direct manual compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and suffered no immediate complications.		A diagnostic mammogram obtained after the procedure showed the marker clip lateral to the expected location lesion seen on MR.  It is likely that there is migration to the most lateral aspect of the biopsy cavity due to the so-called accordion effect when compression was released.  A generous surgical margin medial to the marker would be appropriate if wider excision is needed in future.		The patient was released with standard postbiopsy care instructions after a brief period of observation and will follow up with Dr. [NAME].		IMPRESSION:  		Successful MR-guided biopsy of mass in superior/anterior left breast.  A marker clip was left at the site, but apparently has migrated to the most lateral aspect of the biopsy cavity, so a generous medial margin is needed if wider surgical excision is performed in future.		An addendum to this report will be generated when biopsy results are received.	     EXAM: PATHOLOGY ADDENDUM	ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]		PATHOLOGY OUTCOME SECTION:  Malignant		PATHOLOGY RESULT SECTION: MR guided biopsy results have now been received from [ADDRESS].

Greatest dimension approaches 2 cm but no invasive carcinoma is seen.  Estrogen and progesterone receptors are both positive.		Surgical and oncologic treatment is appropriate.  If breast-conserving lumpectomy is to be performed on the left side, a generous surgical margin medial to the marker clip is advised, due to the clip migration discussed in the original biopsy report.		RECOMMENDATION: 	1: Treatment plan Bilateral"

EXAM: MRI RIGHT BREAST VACUUM ASSISTED BIOPSY WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST
ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]

HISTORY: Indeterminant segmental, linear and branching enhancement seen on recent MRI

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION: 

TECHNIQUE:  Dynamic high-resolution breast MRI was performed pre and post intravenous contrast for biopsy localization purposes.  Gadavist 6 ml.

FINDINGS: 

Written informed consent was obtained for MRI guided biopsy.  The area of enhancement is again seen in the right upper central breast, centered at 12 o'clock.  This was approached from the lateral direction.  The skin was cleansed in the usual sterile fashion.  Subcutaneous lidocaine was utilized for local anesthesia.  A small skin nick was made with a scalpel.

Utilizing grid localization, a 9-gauge trocar was advanced to the area of enhancement.  Axial images were obtained to confirm positioning.  The trocar is in appropriate position.

Utilizing vacuum assistance, multiple specimens were obtained.  A bar clip was deployed.  The trocar was removed and hemostasis was obtained.

Postbiopsy mammogram demonstrates that the larger clip appears in appropriate position.  The ribbon clip at the site of the patient's known malignancy is also seen at 12 o'clock closer to the nipple.

The patient left the Department in satisfactory condition.

EXAM: US BREAST CORE BX RT 1 SITE
ACCESSION: [ID]

HISTORY:  Small shadowing nodularity in the 12 o'clock position of right breast 3 cm from the nipple.

COMPARISON:  Bilateral breast ultrasound performed [DATE].

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION: Indications, benefits, risks and alternatives of this procedure were explained to the patient in [NAME]'s language.  Informed consent was freely given.

A medial to lateral approach was selected.  The targeted mass was readily localized.  It is mildly hypervascular on Doppler imaging.  Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was administered using 1% lidocaine.

A 16 ga. Bard core gun was placed adjacent to the target mass and a total of 3 core specimens were retrieved under continuous sonographic guidance. These were placed in formalin for pathologic analysis.

The patient had more than usual bleeding during the procedure, presumably due to the vascularity of the targeted nodule.  Hemostasis was achieved with direct manual compression.  A marker clip was placed at the site but diagnostic mammography was deferred for now, to prevent recurrent bleeding.

The patient was released with standard postbiopsy care instructions after a brief period of observation and will follow up with Dr. [NAME].

IMPRESSION:  

1.	Successful ultrasound-guided biopsy of small shadowing nodule in the 12 o'clock position of right breast.  A marker clip was left at the site.
2.	Diagnostic mammography was deferred for now because of excess bleeding from this vascular nodule.  If the biopsy results are malignant, atypical, or inconclusive, a diagnostic mammogram should be obtained before any further intervention is performed.

An addendum to this report will be generated when biopsy results are received.

Informed consent was freely given.		A medial to lateral approach was selected.  The thick walled cyst at the 2 o'clock position of left breast, 4 cm from the nipple, was readily localized.  Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was administered using 1% lidocaine.		A 20-gauge hypodermic needle was advanced into the cyst lumen under sonographic guidance without significant difficulty.  Most of the cyst fluid was aspirated, yielding viscous yellowish cyst fluid with a tinge of fresh blood that is probably iatrogenic.  The specimen was placed in a CytoLyt vial for cytopathologic analysis.		Identical technique was used to aspirate the complex cystic lesion in the 2:30 position of left breast 3 cm from the nipple.  Again, much of the fluid component was aspirated, leaving some likely internal debris.  This viscous yellowish fluid was placed in a separate CytoLyt vial for cytopathologic analysis.		Hemostasis was achieved with direct manual compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and suffered no immediate complications.		The patient was released with standard postbiopsy care instructions after a brief period of observation and will follow up with Dr. [NAME].		IMPRESSION:  		Successful ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of 2 complex cyst in the left upper inner quadrant.		An addendum to this report will be generated when cytopathology results are received.		   	     EXAM: PATHOLOGY ADDENDUM	ACCESSION: [ID]		PATHOLOGY OUTCOME SECTION:  Malignant		PATHOLOGY RESULT SECTION: Cytopathology results have now been received from [ADDRESS].

CLINICAL HISTORY:
Patient present for stereotactic guided biopsy of calcifications in the left upper, outer breast at 2 o'clock.

COMPARISON:
Bilateral diagnostic mammogram [DATE]

FINDINGS:
Pertinent imaging was reviewed, confirming the indeterminate calcifications in the left breast at 2 o'clock.

The procedure, including risks, benefits, and alternatives, was discussed with the patient. All questions were answered. Informed written and vertebral consent was obtained.

The skin was then cleaned in the standard sterile fashion. With the patient in craniocaudal compression, from a superior approach, the calcifications were targeted on both scout and stereo views.  Approximately 5 mL of 1% lidocaine was administered to the skin. Using a 10-gauge vacuum-assisted biopsy device, pre and post fire stereotactic guided imaging confirm correct location of the needle. An additional 5 mL of 1% lidocaine was administered through the biopsy device. Multiple specimens were obtained. A biopsy clip was then deployed, confirmed on imaging. Hemostasis was achieved through compression. The skin was then dressed in a clean fashion.

Post biopsy craniocaudal and lateral views demonstrate partial removal of the calcifications with biopsy clip at target.

The specimen radiograph demonstrates multiple calcifications.

The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication. She was given postbiopsy care instructions. She left the radiology department in stable condition.

IMPRESSION:
Technically successful stereotactic guided biopsy of calcifications in the left upper, outer breast at 2 o'clock with biopsy clip at target.  An addendum to this report will be issued once pathology results are available.

The procedures, including risks, benefits, and alternatives, was discussed with the patient.  All questions were answered.  Informed written and verbal consent was obtained.

Under mammogram guidance, the area in question was identified using alphanumeric grid.  The skin was cleaned with alcohol.  Approximately 5 mL of 1% lidocaine was inserted into the skin and subcutaneous soft tissues.  A 5 cm needle was inserted into the breast, confirmed on orthogonal view.  The seed was then deployed successfully.  The skin was dressed in a clean fashion.

Using sterile technique, intradermal and subcutaneous injection of technetium-99m sulfur colloid was performed in the periareolar right breast, dividing the dose into 4 injection sites bracketing the nipple on all sides. There were no immediate complications. Scintigraphic imaging was not requested or performed. Intraoperative sentinel lymph node localization will be carried out by the attending surgeon using a handheld gamma probe.

Post localization craniocaudal and lateral views demonstrate adequate positioning of the localization seed.

The patient tolerated both procedures well without complication.  She left the department in stable condition.

Subcutaneous lidocaine was utilized for local anesthesia.   With mammographic guidance,  a titanium seed containing Dosage: 0.107 mCi I-125 Seed, Implanted was placed at the calcifications. The localization needle was withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complication.		Postprocedure 2 view mammogram demonstrates that the seed is 2 to 3 cm medial to the calcifications.		Therefore, the decision was made to localize the calcifications with an additional wire localization needle.  The calcifications were approached from the lateral direction and utilizing similar technique, a 7 cm long needle was advanced to the calcifications.		Post localization mammogram demonstrates that the calcifications are at the hook of the wire.		IMPRESSION:  I-125 radioactive seed localization and wire localization of calcifications in the posterior right upper outer quadrant. 		SUMMARY:		Number of seeds placed: 1  		Date of scheduled surgery: [DATE]		Dosage: 0.107 mCi I-125 Seed, Implanted		Specimen radiograph demonstrates the localized calcifications within the specimen.

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:

HISTORY:  [AGE]-year-old woman presents for stereotactic guided core needle biopsy of indeterminate calcifications in the 4o'clock position, lower outer quadrant, of the left breast.

PROCEDURE:  After informed written consent was obtained, the patient was placed in a prone position and her left breast was prepped and cleaned in a sterile fashion.  The indeterminate calcifications in the 4 o'clock position of the left breast were then identified stereotactically and the coordinates were determined.  The area was anesthetized locally using 10 cc of 1% lidocaine.  A skin incision was made lateral through which a 9-gauge vacuum assisted biopsy device was deployed.  After the needle position was confirmed, multiple specimens were obtained.  The specimen radiograph confirmed the presence of targeted calcifications.  At the end of the procedure, a microclip was deployed at the biopsy site.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complication.  The specimens were labeled and sent to [ADDRESS] for analysis. 

Postprocedure mammographic views of the left breast confirmed the presence of the microclip in the expected location.

CLINICAL HISTORY:
Patient presents for stereotactic guided biopsy of left upper, outer breast calcifications.

COMPARISON:
Left breast diagnostic mammogram [DATE], screening mammogram [DATE]

FINDINGS:
Pertinent imaging was reviewed, confirming the indeterminate calcifications in the left upper, outer breast at 2 o'clock.

The procedure, including risks, benefits, and alternatives, was discussed with the patient. All questions were answered. Informed written and vertebral consent was obtained.

The skin was then cleaned in the standard sterile fashion. With the patient in lateral medial compression, from a lateral approach, the calcifications were targeted on both scout and stereo views.  Approximately 5 mL of 1% lidocaine was administered to the skin. Using a 10-gauge vacuum-assisted biopsy device, pre and post fire stereotactic guided imaging confirm correct location of the needle. An additional 5 mL of 1% lidocaine was administered through the biopsy device. Multiple specimens were obtained. A biopsy clip was then deployed, confirmed on imaging. Hemostasis was achieved through compression. The skin was then dressed in a clean fashion.

Post biopsy craniocaudal and lateral views demonstrate partial removal of the calcifications with biopsy clip 4.3 cm lateral to the target.  Note is made of residual calcifications at the biopsy site if potential surgical planning is necessary.

The specimen radiograph demonstrates multiple calcifications.

The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication. She was given postbiopsy care instructions. She left the radiology department in stable condition.

IMPRESSION:
Technically successful stereotactic biopsy of calcifications in the left breast at 2 o'clock with biopsy clip as described above.  An addendum to this report will be issued once pathology results are available.

HISTORY:  Bilateral breast masses with extensive abnormal enhancement on breast MRI.

COMPARISON:  Mammogram and ultrasound of [DATE].  Breast MR [DATE].  Second look ultrasound of both breasts dated [DATE].

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION: Indications, benefits, risks and alternatives of this procedure were explained to the patient in [NAME]'s language.  Informed consent was freely given.

There are 5 targets for biopsy that have been selected from the MR and ultrasound studies, 3 on the left and 2 on the right.  These include the following:

1.	Dominant solid mass of 3.1 cm diameter at the left 1 to 2 o'clock position deep in the axillary tail.
2.	Hypoechoic nodule 0.5 cm diameter lying at the left 9 o'clock position 4-5 cm from the nipple.
3.	Left axillary lymph node 2.3 x 1.0 cm diameter with mild cortical thickening.
4.	Irregular hypoechoic solid mass 1.1 cm diameter in the right 1-2 o'clock position 5 cm from the nipple.
5.	Irregular hypoechoic mass 0.5 cm diameter in the right 12 o'clock position 6 cm from the nipple.

Lesion 1: The dominant solid mass in the left axillary tail was targeted first.  A lateral to medial approach was selected.  The targeted mass was readily localized.  Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was administered using 1% lidocaine.

A 16 ga. Bard Marquis core gun was placed adjacent to the target mass and a total of  3  core specimens were retrieved under continuous sonographic guidance. These were placed in formalin for pathologic analysis. An MR-compatible ribbon-shaped Inrad marker clip was then deployed through the guide needle in the usual manner.

Lesion 2: The subcentimeter hypoechoic nodule in the 9 o'clock position left breast was then targeted for biopsy using identical technique to that noted above.  Only 2 specimens could be obtained before the nodule was no longer visible, presumably representing lysis of a complex cyst.  A wing-shaped MR compatible Inrad marker clip was then deployed at the site.

Lesion 3: The prominent left axillary lymph node was then targeted for biopsy using identical technique to that noted above.  3 specimens were obtained with a 16-gauge Bard Marquis core gun under sonographic guidance.  A sonographically visible Twirl marker was then deployed in the lymph node in the usual manner.

Lesion 4: The dominant solid mass 1.1 cm diameter in the right 1 to 2 o'clock position was then targeted, again using identical technique to that detailed above.  3 specimens were obtained with the 16-gauge Bard Marquis core gun.  An MR-compatible ribbon-shaped Inrad marker clip was deployed at the site in the usual manner.

Lesion 5: The hypoechoic 0.5 cm nodule in the 12 o'clock position right breast was then targeted for biopsy using identical technique to that previously described.  3 specimens were obtained with a 16-gauge Bard Marquis core gun.  A wing-shaped MR-compatible Inrad marker clip was deployed at the site in the usual manner.

Hemostasis was achieved at all biopsy sites with direct manual compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and suffered no immediate complications.

Diagnostic mammography demonstrated marker clips at the sites of lesions 1, 2, 4 and 5, corresponding to the above descriptions and to the areas of concern noted on prior imaging studies.  The clip at lesion 3, a left axillary lymph node, is out of view to mammography.

The patient was released with standard postbiopsy care instructions after a brief period of observation and will follow up with Dr. [NAME].

PATHOLOGY OUTCOME SECTION:  Malignant

PATHOLOGY RESULT SECTION:  Biopsy results have now been received from [ADDRESS].  Accession number was [ID].

As expected, this biopsy demonstrated bilateral invasive ductal carcinoma.

Specimen A on the pathology report is from the 1:30 position of right breast 5 cm from the nipple.  This corresponds to lesion 4 on the biopsy report.  It shows invasive ductal carcinoma with calcifications, at least 8.5 mm diameter, of Nottingham grade 1.  No ductal or lobular carcinoma in situ seen.  There is no lymphovascular invasion.  Estrogen and progesterone receptors are both positive.

Specimen B on the pathology report is from the left axillary tail and corresponds to lesion 1 on the biopsy report.  It showed invasive ductal carcinoma at least 10 mm maximal diameter, of Nottingham grade 2.  There was no ductal carcinoma in situ or lobular carcinoma in situ.  No lymphovascular invasion was seen.  Estrogen and progesterone receptors were both positive.

Specimen C on the pathology report is from the 9 o'clock position left breast 4 cm from the nipple, corresponding to lesion 2 on the biopsy report.  There was benign breast tissue with nonproliferative fibrocystic changes.  No malignancy or atypia was noted.

Specimen D on the [ADDRESS] report is the left axillary lymph node, designated lesion 3 on the biopsy report.  This proved to be a benign lymph node on histopathologic exam, with no evidence for malignancy.

Specimen E on the pathology report is from the 12 o'clock position of right breast 6 cm from the nipple, corresponding to lesion 5 on the biopsy report.  This showed benign breast tissue with nonproliferative fibrocystic changes, with no evidence for atypia or malignancy.

The MR findings in the left breast remain highly suspicious for extensive multifocal and probably multicentric malignancy, involving at least a dozen foci of suspicious enhancement spread over a total anteroposterior distance of at least 9 cm, despite the absence of malignancy in the 9 o'clock position on the current biopsy.  If breast conserving treatment is still being contemplated, MR guided biopsy of at least one of the many suspicious enhancing nodules that lie between the nipple and the primary mass in the deep left upper outer quadrant/proximal axillary tail would be advised.  The lesion at the anterior 3 o'clock position on transaxial MR image 40/700 and sagittal image 133/600, or the 1.8 cm lesion in the 2:00 middle position of left breast on transaxial image 34/700 and sagittal image 133/600 would both make good targets for MR guided biopsy.  Several small foci of suspicious enhancement in the anterior lower inner quadrant of left breast are seen best on sagittal image 142 of series 600, and MR biopsy of one of these could confirm multicentric malignancy.

EXAM: NEEDLE SEED LOCAL INITIAL LEFT BREAST	ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]		HISTORY:  Ductal carcinoma in situ at the 3 o'clock position of left breast, adjoining a hat-shaped biopsy marker clip.    		COMPARISON: Postbiopsy mammograms of [DATE] and [DATE].		PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION: 		TECHNIQUE:  After informed written consent was obtained, the patient's breast was prepped and cleaned. Subcutaneous lidocaine was utilized for local anesthesia.   With mammographic guidance,  a titanium seed containing  0.112 mCi I125 was placed within 1 cm medial to the marker clip and adjacent microcalcifications in the lateral left breast. The localization needle was withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complication.		Postprocedure 2 view mammogram confirms the titanium seed in the appropriate location.		Subsequent specimen radiographs from the surgery department at Honor Health showed the radioactive seed, together with most or all of the remaining punctate microcalcifications at the biopsy site, although the hat-shaped marker clip was not depicted despite additional specimens taken from all sides of the excisional cavity.		IMPRESSION: Successful I-125 radioactive seed localization and subsequent excision. 		SUMMARY:		Number of seeds placed: 1  		Date of scheduled surgery: [DATE]				     EXAM: PATHOLOGY ADDENDUM	ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]		PATHOLOGY OUTCOME SECTION:  Malignant		PATHOLOGY RESULT SECTION: Surgical pathology results following radioactive marker seed placement and surgical excision have now been received from [ADDRESS].  Accession number was [ID]. 		Specimen radiographs were reviewed with Dr. [NAME] at the time of surgery, and are reviewed again today.  The initial surgical specimen contains the radioactive marker seed that was placed the same day, as well as a number of punctate microcalcifications, some of which extend relatively close to the cut margin at grid location N5.  8 other specimens were also obtained from the margins and imaged, most of them showing at least a few calcifications.  None of the specimens show any discrete mass.  None of them contain the biopsy marker clip that lay within 4 mm of the radioactive marker seed on the post-deployment/preoperative mammograms, and presumably it fell from the cut margin at the time of surgery.		Specimen A is the initial resection specimen containing the radioactive marker seed.  It shows residual high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ of nuclear grade 3 involving sclerosis adenosis, spanning a diameter of 8 mm.  There were solid and cribriform architectural patterns with comedonecrosis.  Margins of surgical resection were less than 1 mm posteriorly, 1 mm anteriorly, 1 mm laterally, 12 mm inferiorly, 8 mm medially and 10 mm superiorly.  The previous biopsy site was observed within.  Microcalcifications were seen in association with benign sclerosing adenosis as well as areas of DCIS.		Specimen B from the medial margin, specimen C from the superior margin, specimen D from the lateral margin, specimen F from the posterior margin, and specimen G from the revised anterior margin showed no evidence for malignancy or atypia.  There was sclerosing adenosis and associated microcalcification in all but specimens B and G, and the margins of surgical resection were benign in all of these specimens.		Specimen E from the inferior margin showed sclerosing adenosis with associated microcalcifications as well as lobular carcinoma in situ.  Margins of surgical resection were benign.		Specimen H from the revised superolateral margin showed focal lobular carcinoma in situ and focal high-grade comedo type ductal carcinoma in situ of grade 3, spanning less than 1 mm.  Margins were clear but DCIS was 1 mm from the revised margin.		No lymph nodes were submitted or found.		RECOMMENDATION: 	1: Treatment plan Left"

EXAM: MRI-GUIDED LEFT BREAST VACUUM-ASSISTED BIOPSY, 2 SITES, WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST - 	WITH DIAGNOSTIC MAMMOGRAM	ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]		HISTORY: Enhancing nodule in the 7 o'clock position of left lower inner quadrant. Linear non-mass enhancement in the 8:30-9 o'clock position of left lower inner quadrant. These are designated Site 1 and Site 2, respectively, in this report.		COMPARISON:  Breast MR of [DATE]		TECHNIQUE:  Dynamic high-resolution breast MRI was performed pre and post intravenous contrast for biopsy localization purposes.  Gadavist 8 ml.  Two specimens sent to Honor Health		PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:		Indications, benefits, risks and alternatives of this procedure were explained to the patient in [NAME]'s language.  Informed consent was freely given.		A medial to lateral approach was selected. Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion.   MR imaging was performed with the breast held in compression with a gridded compression paddle. Site 1 at 7:00 in the middle third of the left lower inner quadrant was localized first. Site 2 at the 8:30-9:00 middle position of left lower inner quadrant was localized second.		At each of these 2 sites, local anesthesia was administered using 1% lidocaine. A short incision was made in the skin with a #11 blade. A guide sheath was applied over a trocar. A stylet was then placed in the guide sheath, and MR images were repeated to confirm accurate placement. 		Following MR confirmation of accurate localization, both sites then underwent biopsy through the sheath using handheld 9 gauge Suros biopsy probes. 12  core specimens were retrieved at each site under vacuum assist. These were placed in separate vials of formalin for pathologic analysis.		An MR compatible marker clip was then deployed through the guide sheath at each site in the usual manner. Site 1, at the 7 o'clock position, received a cylindrical cork-shaped marker, while a dumbbell-shaped marker was used at site 2 in the 8:30 to 9 o'clock position.		Hemostasis was achieved with direct manual compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and suffered no immediate complications.		A diagnostic mammogram obtained after the procedure showed both marker clips at the expected locations of the targeted lesions. At both sites, the markers lie at the deeper/more lateral aspect of the biopsy cavities, so generous medial surgical margins would be advised if wider surgical excision is required in future.		The patient was released with standard postbiopsy care instructions after a brief period of observation and will follow up with Dr. [NAME].		IMPRESSION:  		Successful MR-guided biopsy of 2 sites in the left lower inner quadrant.  A marker clip was left at each site, as described in detail above.		An addendum to this report will be generated when biopsy results are received.	     EXAM: Pathology Addendum 	ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]		PATHOLOGY OUTCOME SECTION:  High Risk		PATHOLOGY RESULT SECTION:  Pathology from to site MR guided core biopsy performed by Dr. [NAME] on [DATE] returns.		Results show atypical ductal hyperplasia and intraductal papilloma for the 7 o'clock position biopsy.

Informed consent was freely given.		The shadowing spiculated dominant mass in the 10 o'clock position of left breast 10 cm from the nipple, and the subcentimeter satellite nodule nearby, were readily identified sonographically.  Both of these lesions were localized for surgical excision later today, using sterile technique.  Local anesthesia was applied with 1% lidocaine.  A 7 cm Kopans needle was applied to the dominant mass and a 5 cm Kopans needle to the smaller adjacent nodule. A lateral to medial approach was used and Kopans hook wires were deployed through each needle after tip position was confirmed.		Again using sterile technique with 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia, 2 abnormal lymph nodes in the left axilla were marked with 0.25 mL of methylene blue dye each, under sonographic guidance.  These appear to be the same nodes as previously biopsied, with internal echogenicities concordant with the marker devices placed at the time of biopsy, but the deeper node in particular appears less conspicuous and less reliably identified than before.		Finally, 1 mCi of technetium-99m 99m sulfur colloid was administered intradermally and subcutaneously in the periareolar left breast after sterile prep.  The dose was divided into 4 injection sites bracketing the nipple on all sides.  Scintigraphic imaging was not requested or performed.  Intraoperative sentinel lymph node localization will be carried out by the attending surgeon using a handheld gamma probe.		A post-localization diagnostic mammogram of the left breast shows that the 2 Kopans hook wires accurately localize the targeted masses in the left upper inner quadrant.  The marker clips left at biopsy are immediately adjacent to the deeper aspect of the thick collar of each Kopans wire.		The patient tolerated these procedures well and did not suffer any immediate complications she was released to preop in stable condition, accompanied by printed hard copy films of the post localization diagnostic mammogram marked to guide surgical excision.		An addendum to this report will be generated when specimen radiographs and surgical pathology results are received.		IMPRESSION:		1.

CLINICAL HISTORY:
Patient presents for stereotactic guided biopsy calcifications in the right central, retroareolar breast.

COMPARISON:
Breast diagnostic mammogram [DATE], screening mammogram [DATE]

FINDINGS:
Pertinent imaging was reviewed, confirming the indeterminate calcifications in the right central, retroareolar breast, middle depth.

The procedure, including risks, benefits, and alternatives, was discussed with the patient. All questions were answered. Informed written and vertebral consent was obtained.

The skin was then cleaned in the standard sterile fashion. With the patient in craniocaudal compression, from a inferior approach, the calcifications were targeted on both scout and stereo views.  Approximately 5 mL of 1% lidocaine was administered to the skin. Using a 10-gauge vacuum-assisted biopsy device, pre and post fire stereotactic guided imaging confirm correct location of the needle. An additional 5 mL of 1% lidocaine was administered through the biopsy device. Multiple specimens were obtained. A biopsy clip was then deployed, confirmed on imaging. Hemostasis was achieved through compression. The skin was then dressed in a clean fashion.

Post biopsy craniocaudal and lateral views demonstrate partial removal of the calcifications with biopsy clip at target.

The specimen radiograph demonstrates multiple calcifications.

The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication. She was given postbiopsy care instructions. She left the radiology department in stable condition.

IMPRESSION:
Technically successful stereotactic guided biopsy of calcifications in the central, retroareolar breast with biopsy clip targeted.  An addendum to this report will be issued once the pathology results are available.

EXAM: ULTRASOUND-GUIDED RIGHT BREAST CORE BIOPSY
ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]

HISTORY:  Patient presents for ultrasound-guided biopsy of the indeterminate right periareolar breast mass.

COMPARISON:  Bilateral diagnostic mammogram and right breast ultrasound [DATE]

FINDINGS:

Pertinent imaging was reviewed, confirming the target location of the right breast mass at 12 o'clock, periareolar.

The procedure, including risks, benefits, alternatives, was discussed with the patient. All questions were answered. Informed written and vertebral consent was obtained.

The area in question was again imaged under ultrasound.  Note is made of additional smaller hypoechoic indeterminate areas adjacent to the targeted mass.  The skin was then dressed and draped in the standard sterile fashion. Approximately 5 mL of 1% lidocaine was administered into the skin. A small incision was made. Under ultrasound guidance, a 14-gauge coaxial Bard biopsy device was inserted into the breast. Multiple specimens were obtained. Under ultrasound guidance, a biopsy clip was then placed at the site. Hemostasis was achieved through compression. The skin was dressed in a clean fashion.

Post biopsy craniocaudal and lateral views demonstrate the biopsy clip at the target location.

The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication. She was given postbiopsy care instructions. She left the department in stable condition.

IMPRESSION:

1.	Technically successful ultrasound-guided biopsy of the right breast mass at 12 o'clock with biopsy clip at target. An addendum to this report will be issued once pathology results are available.
2.	Given the additional areas of concern, if the pathology results proved positive, breast MRI with contrast might be considered to assess for multifocal disease.     EXAM: Pathology Addendum

EXAM: STEREOTACTIC BIOPSY, WITH CLIP, SPECIMEN AND DIAGNOSTIC MAMMOGRAM	ACCESSION: [ID]		HISTORY:  Developing microcalcifications in the upper inner quadrant of right breast.		COMPARISON:  Diagnostic right breast mammogram of [DATE].  Bilateral screening mammograms performed [DATE], [DATE] and [DATE].		PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION: Indications, benefits, risks and alternatives of this procedure were explained to the patient in [NAME]'s language.  Informed consent was freely given.		This patient has 3 rather closely adjacent clusters of microcalcifications in the upper inner quadrant of right breast that all lie between 1:00 and 3:00 at posterior depth.  The most cranial/posterior/medial cluster and the most anterior/inferior/lateral cluster both appear to have been present previously, while the third cluster that lies in between shows year over year progression and was therefore targeted for biopsy.		A medial to lateral approach was selected.  Separating and identifying the different clusters of microcalcification was quite challenging.  The selected target appeared to be the same as the target that was chosen on the diagnostic mammograms from [DATE].  Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was administered using 1% lidocaine.		A short incision was made in the skin with a #11 blade.  A 9-gauge Suros vacuum-assisted biopsy probe was advanced through the skin incision and deployed in the usual manner without incident.  5 core specimens were retrieved through the biopsy probe.		Magnification specimen radiography revealed microcalcifications concordant with the biopsy target on all but one specimen.  The biopsy specimens were placed in formalin for pathologic analysis.		An MR-compatible marker clip was then deployed through the probe sheath in the usual manner.  Hemostasis was achieved with direct manual compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and suffered no immediate complications.		A diagnostic mammogram obtained after the procedure showed the marker clip lying too medial, anterior, and inferior to be at the desired target.  That cluster lies cranial, lateral and posterior to the clip, and most or all of them remain in place after biopsy.  We therefore attempted a second-pass biopsy directed at the chosen target, but despite attempting this procedure from multiple approaches, we were never able to definitively separate out the target site from the other surrounding stable calcifications. The second biopsy attempt was therefore abandoned.  We will await the results of the completed biopsy and then send the patient for surgical consultation for possible excisional biopsy.		The patient was released with standard postbiopsy care instructions after a brief period of observation and will followup with Dr. [NAME].		IMPRESSION:  		This challenging stereotactic biopsy succeeded in sampling many microcalcifications in the right upper inner quadrant.  However, the postbiopsy mammogram suggests that the sampled calcifications do not represent the desired target, but one of 2 other nearby stable clusters of calcification that do not require biopsy.  We were not able to successfully complete a second pass because of overlapping calcifications and uncertainty as to the desired target.  Final disposition will await the biopsy results, after which the patient will probably need to consult a surgeon regarding excisional biopsy for definitive evaluation.  An addendum to this report will be generated when the biopsy results are received.

ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]

HISTORY:  Right breast carcinoma

COMPARISON:  Mammograms of [DATE], [DATE], and [DATE].

PROCEDURE:

Indications, benefits, risks and alternatives of this procedure were explained to the patient in [NAME]'s language.  Informed consent was freely given.

The medial to lateral approach was selected.  The spiculated mass containing an X-shaped marker clip at the 3:00 middle position of right breast was readily localized using a fenestrated compression paddle.  Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was administered with 1% lidocaine.

A 7 cm Kopans needle was advanced past the marker clip under mammographic guidance.  After needle tip position was confirmed in orthogonal projections, a Kopans hookwire was deployed through the needle in the usual manner without difficulty.  After deployment, the mass surrounds the deeper aspect of the thick wire collar, and the tip of the hook is just lateral to the mass.  On the lateral projection after wire placement, there are some spicules extending cranial to the mass, so a generous superior surgical margin was advised.

1 mCi of technetium-99m sulfur colloid was then administered in the periareolar right breast under sterile conditions.  The dose was divided into 4 intradermal/subcutaneous injection sites bracketing the nipple.  Scintigraphic imaging was not requested or performed.  Intraoperative sentinel lymph node localization will be carried out by the attending surgeon using a handheld gamma probe.

The patient tolerated these procedures well and suffered no immediate complications.  She was released to preop in stable condition, with printed copies of the imaging to guide surgical intervention.

IMPRESSION:

1.	Successful wire localization of a malignant spiculated mass in the medial right breast.  A generous cranial surgical margin is suggested.

2.	Successful periareolar intradermal and subcutaneous technetium-99m sulfur colloid obstruction for intraoperative sentinel lymph node localization.

HISTORY: Patient presents for MR guided biopsy of an enhancing mass in the left breast at 2 o'clock.  Patient has history of intraductal papilloma at 4 o'clock in the left breast status post excisional biopsy demonstrating DCIS.  Recent breast MRI demonstrated 2 enhancing nodules in the upper, outer quadrant at 2 o'clock for which the more posterior and larger area will be targeted on today's exam.

COMPARISON:  Breast MRI [DATE], left breast ultrasound-guided biopsy and postbiopsy mammogram 318, bilateral breast ultrasound [DATE], screening mammogram [DATE] 

TECHNIQUE:  Dynamic high-resolution breast MRI was performed pre and post intravenous contrast for biopsy localization purposes.  Gadavist 7.5 ml.     

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:  After informed written consent was obtained, the patient was placed in a prone position and multiplanar images in various sequences were acquired through the left breast.  The left breast was then prepped and cleaned in a sterile fashion.  The mass in the upper, outer breast at 2 o'clock was then identified and the coordinates were determined.  The area was anesthetized locally using 10 cc of 1% lidocaine.  A skin incision was made laterally through which an introducer was placed.  After the position was confirmed, multiple specimens were obtained using a 9-gauge vacuum assisted biopsy device.  At the end of the procedure, a microclip was deployed at the biopsy site.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complication.  The specimens were labeled and sent to [ADDRESS] for analysis. 

Postprocedure mammographic views of the left breast confirm the presence of the barrel-shaped microclip in the expected location.

EXAM: NEEDLE SEED LOCAL INITIAL BILATERAL BREAST, WITH LYMPHOSCINTIGRAPHY INJECTION IN RIGHT BREAST	ACCESSION: [ID], [ID], [ID], [ID], [ID]		HISTORY:  Atypical lobular hyperplasia in the left upper outer quadrant. Invasive ductal carcinoma and atypical ductal hyperplasia in the right upper outer quadrant. 		PROCEDURE:  After informed written consent was obtained, the patient's right breast was prepped and cleaned. Subcutaneous lidocaine was utilized for local anesthesia.   With mammographic guidance, a titanium seed containing 0.167 mCi I-125 was placed within 1 cm of the wing-shaped marker at the biopsy site in the 11 o'clock position of right upper outer quadrant. The localization needle was withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complication.		1 mCi of technetium-99m sulfur colloid was then administered intradermally and subcutaneously in the periareolar right breast, dividing the dose into 4 injection sites to bracket the nipple on all sides.  Scintigraphic imaging was not requested or performed.  Intraoperative sentinel lymph node localization will be performed by the attending surgeon using a handheld gamma probe.		The cylindrical marker at the biopsy site in the 2 to 3 o'clock position of left upper outer quadrant was then targeted for radioactive seed localization in the same manner as the lesion on the right side.  Using sterile technique with mammographic guidance and lidocaine for local anesthesia, another radioactive seed containing 0.167 mCi I-125 was deployed immediately adjacent to the biopsy site.		Postprocedure bilateral mammograms confirm that the titanium seeds are placed in the appropriate location adjacent to the 2 previous biopsy sites of ongoing concern.		Later in the same morning, bilateral breast specimen radiographs were sent from [ADDRESS]  The specimens from the right breast show the radioactive marker seed within a collection vial.  The wing-shaped biopsy site marker device that was targeted for resection was also present in one of the specimens.  Ill-defined, vaguely spiculated tumor extends to the cut surface of the specimen, but Dr. [NAME] reports that she resected additional specimens from the margins of the surgical bed on this side to ensure complete extirpation of the mass.  The specimen taken from the left breast contains the radioactive seed as well as the biopsy marker site, but no mass or suspicious microcalcification.		IMPRESSION:	1.	Successful I-125 radioactive seed localization in both breasts, for intraoperative guidance of surgical excision of previous bilateral biopsy sites.	2.	Successful periareolar technetium-99m sulfur colloid administration in the right breast, for intraoperative guidance of right axillary sentinel lymph node localization.	3.	Subsequent specimen radiography confirms accurate localization and resection of both of the titanium seeds that were placed today.  Both of the previously seen biopsy site marker devices were successfully resected as well.	4.	An addendum to this report will be generated when surgical pathology results are received.		SUMMARY:		Number of seeds placed: 2  		Date of scheduled surgery: [DATE]"

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:

Indications, benefits, risks and alternatives of this procedure were explained to the patient in [NAME]'s language.  Informed consent was freely given.

A lateral to medial approach was selected. Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion.   MR imaging was performed with the breast held in compression with a gridded compression paddle. The targeted lesion was readily localized.  

Local anesthesia was administered using 1% lidocaine. A short incision was made in the skin with a #11 blade. A guide sheath was applied over a trocar. A stylet was then placed in the guide sheath, and MR images were repeated to confirm accurate placement. 

A handheld 9 gauge Suros biopsy probe was then advanced through the guide sheath, and a total of  12  core specimens were retrieved under vacuum assist. These were placed in formalin for pathologic analysis.

An MR-compatible cork-shaped marker device was then deployed through the guide sheath in the usual manner.  

Hemostasis was achieved with direct manual compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and suffered no immediate complications.

A diagnostic mammogram obtained after the procedure showed the marker clip at the expected location of the targeted lesion.

The patient was released with standard postbiopsy care instructions after a brief period of observation and will follow up with Dr. [NAME].

These were placed in formalin for pathologic analysis.

An MR-compatible marker clip was then deployed through the probe sheath in the usual manner.  Hemostasis was achieved with direct manual compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and suffered no immediate complications.

A diagnostic mammogram obtained after the procedure showed the marker clip in the left upper inner quadrant just lateral to the area of concern, apparently having migrated to the lateral aspect of the biopsy cavity due to the accordion effect when compression was released.  This should be taken into account if wider surgical excision is contemplated.

The patient was released with standard postbiopsy care instructions after a brief period of observation and will followup with Dr. [NAME].

IMPRESSION:  

Apparently successful stereotactic biopsy of architectural distortion in the left upper inner quadrant.  A marker clip was left at the site, but migrated to the lateral aspect of the biopsy cavity when compression was released.  If wider surgical excision is to be performed in future, a generous surgical margin medial to the marker clip would be advisable.

An addendum to this report will be generated when biopsy results are received.     EXAM: PATHOLOGY ADDENDUM
ACCESSION: [ID]

PATHOLOGY OUTCOME SECTION:  Benign

PATHOLOGY RESULT SECTION: Stereotactic biopsy results have now been received from [ADDRESS].  Accession number was [ID]. 

The biopsy specimen showed benign breast tissue with nonproliferative fibrocystic changes and a single-lumen a possible calcification.  There is no evidence of malignancy or atypia.

ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]

HISTORY:  1.1 cm retroareolar nodule in left breast, with a borderline prominent lymph node in left axilla.

COMPARISON:  Diagnostic mammogram and sonogram dated [DATE].

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION: Indications, benefits, risks and alternatives of this procedure were explained to the patient in [NAME]'s language.  Informed consent was freely given.

A lateral to medial approach was selected.  The targeted retroareolar mass was readily localized.  Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was administered using 1% lidocaine.

A 16 ga. Achieve core gun was placed adjacent to the target mass and a total of 4 core specimens were retrieved under continuous sonographic guidance. These were placed in formalin for pathologic analysis.

An MR-compatible ribbon-shaped Hologic marker clip was then deployed through the guide needle in the usual manner.  Hemostasis was achieved with direct manual compression.

Using identical technique, the most conspicuous node in the left axilla was then sampled, using a 16-gauge Bard Marquis core gun under continuous sonographic guidance.  5 core specimens were retrieved.  3 of these were placed in formalin for histopathologic analysis, while the other 2 cores were placed in a collection vial for flow cytometry.  A coil-shaped, sonographically visible Twirl marker was then deployed in the target node.

The patient tolerated these procedures well and suffered no immediate complications.

A diagnostic mammogram obtained after the procedure showed the marker clip within the retroareolar nodule that was previously seen on mammogram.  The axillary nodal marker clip is out of view to mammography.

The patient was released with standard postbiopsy care instructions after a brief period of observation and will follow up with Dr. [NAME].

IMPRESSION:  

1.	Successful ultrasound-guided biopsy of retroareolar mass in left breast.  A ribbon-shaped marker clip was left at the site.

2.	Successful ultrasound-guided biopsy of borderline prominent left axillary lymph node.  A coil-shaped sonographically-visible marker clip was left at the site.

PATHOLOGY OUTCOME SECTION:  Malignant

PATHOLOGY RESULT SECTION: Ultrasound-guided core biopsy results have now been received from [ADDRESS].  Accession number was SE18-01602. 

The primary breast lesion, located in the retroareolar left breast, contained infiltrating ductal carcinoma.  Tumor size was indeterminate but diameter was at least 1.1 cm.  Nottingham histologic grade was 2.  No in situ carcinoma or lymphovascular invasion was identified.  Estrogen and progesterone receptors were both positive.

The second biopsy, sampling the dominant left axillary lymph node, showed only fragments of a benign reactive lymph node without specific evidence for nodal metastasis.  The path report notes that some malignancies may only partially involve a lymph node, and thus could be missed on limited needle core biopsy.  Excisional sentinel lymph node excision would therefore be appropriate for definitive axillary nodal evaluation.

The 2 target nodules lie fairly close together in the 10:30 position of right breast 5 cm from the nipple, and the 10:00 o'clock position of right breast 2 cm from the nipple. These are designated Site 1 and Site 2 respectively, and are approachable for needle biopsy through a single skin entry site located lateral to both targets.  Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was administered using 1% lidocaine.		The 1.4 cm nodule with angular borders at Site 1 was targeted for the first biopsy. A 16 ga. Bard core gun was placed adjacent to the target mass and a total of 3 core specimens were retrieved under continuous sonographic guidance. These were placed in formalin for pathologic analysis. An MR-compatible ribbon-shaped Bard marker clip was then deployed through the guide needle in the usual manner.		The 1.2 cm nodule of similar angular appearance at Site 2 was then targeted for the second biopsy.

HISTORY:  [AGE]-year-old woman with a history of Epstein-Barr virus and chronic fatigue syndrome presents for ultrasound guided core needle biopsy of an enlarged right axillary lymph node.  The patient has a history of a left mastectomy.

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:  After informed written consent was obtained, the patient's right breast was prepped and cleaned in a sterile fashion.  The prominent right axillary lymph node was identified sonographically.  The area was anesthetized locally using 8 cc of 1% lidocaine.  A skin incision was made laterally through which an introducer was placed and 3  samples were obtained using a 16 Bard core needle biopsy device under ultrasound guidance.  At the end of the procedure, a twirl shaped microclip was deployed at the biopsy site.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complication.  The specimens were labelled and sent to [ADDRESS] and flow cytometry for analysis.

Post procedure mammographic views of the right breast were deferred due to the high location of the lesion in the axilla.

PATHOLOGY RESULT SECTION:  The pathology report for the biopsy of the right axillary lymph node reads ""metastatic carcinoma consistent with a breast primary.""  In the comments it states ""given the patient's history of previous invasive ductal carcinoma, findings are consistent with metastatic breast adenocarcinoma.""  It is uncertain if the metastatic carcinoma is related to the contralateral left breast cancer diagnosed in [DATE] or if there is a new right breast primary.  I believe it would be prudent for the patient undergo a breast MRI to evaluate for any radiographically occult disease.

EXAM: RIGHT BREAST NEEDLE LOCALIZATION WITH SENTINEL INJECTION	ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]		HISTORY:  Newly diagnosed infiltrating ductal carcinoma in a 7 mm nodule lying at the 8 o'clock position of right breast 6 cm from the nipple.		COMPARISON:  Ultrasound-guided core biopsy and postbiopsy mammogram of [DATE] at SimonMed.		PROCEDURE:		Indications, benefits, risks and alternatives of this procedure were explained to the patient in [NAME]'s language.  Informed consent was freely given.		A lateral to medial approach was selected.  The biopsy marker clip lying within a subcentimeter nodule in the right lower outer quadrant was readily localized using a fenestrated compression paddle.  Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion and anesthetized with 1% lidocaine.		A 9 cm Kopans needle was then advanced past the target site under mammographic guidance.  Once the needle tip position was confirmed with orthogonal projections, a Kopans hookwire was deployed through the needle without incident.  The mammograms obtained during the procedure showed that when the Kopans needle was applied, it contacted and fractured the biopsy marker clip.  The more lateral/superficial clip fragment remained within the neoplastic nodule, and was targeted for this localization, while another fragment was displaced deeper and more medial to the target site and was ignored.  Following deployment, the tip of the Kopans wire is 2 or 3 mm anterior to the target nodule and the clip fragment that remained with it.		Using sterile technique, a millicurie of technetium-99m sulfur colloid was then injected intradermally and subcutaneously in the periareolar right breast, dividing the dose into 4 injection sites to bracket the nipple on all sides.  There were no immediate complications.  Scintigraphic imaging was not requested or performed.  Intraoperative sentinel lymph node localization will be carried out by the attending surgeon using a handheld gamma probe.		The patient tolerated the procedure well and did not suffer any immediate complications.  She was released to preop in stable condition.  A hard copy of her post localization mammograms was printed and marked to accompany her to surgery.		Subsequently, a specimen radiograph acquired intraoperatively at [ADDRESS] was sent for review.  It shows the target nodule and the fragment of the biopsy clip that remained with it, approaching within 2 mm of the cut margin of the excisional specimen.  An additional specimen from the periphery of the surgical bed did not show any mass or additional clip fragments.  The case was discussed with Dr. [NAME] intraoperatively.		An addendum to this report will be generated when surgical pathology results are received.		IMPRESSION:		Wire localization and subsequent resection of the previous biopsy site in the lower outer quadrant of right breast.  The case was complicated by an unusual fragmentation of the biopsy marker clip when the Kopans needle was applied.  Margin and may not be entirely cleared.  It is likely that the target has been resected in toto, although involvement of the cranial margin could be present.		Dosage: 1.0 mCi Tc99m Filtered Sulfur Colloid injected intradermally			     EXAM: PATHOLOGY ADDENDUM	ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]		PATHOLOGY OUTCOME SECTION:  Malignant		PATHOLOGY RESULT SECTION: Surgical pathology results following wire localization and surgical excision have now been received from [ADDRESS].  Accession number was [ID]. 		Specimen A consisted of 2 sentinel lymph nodes from the right axilla.  They were both negative for malignancy.		Specimen B was the primary lumpectomy specimen.  It contained invasive ductal carcinoma of Nottingham grade 2, at least 0.8 cm maximal diameter.  No DCIS was seen.  There was no lymphovascular invasion.  The anterior margin of the specimen was focally positive for invasive carcinoma, showing involvement of less than 1 mm of arc on 1 histologic slide.

EXAM: MRI-GUIDED LEFT BREAST VACUUM-ASSISTED BIOPSY, WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST - 	WITH DIAGNOSTIC MAMMOGRAM	ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]		HISTORY: High risk patient.  Screening MR shows 2 small foci of enhancement in the lower inner quadrant of left breast at the 7:00 and 9:00 positions.		COMPARISON:  Bilateral breast MR dated [DATE].		TECHNIQUE:  Dynamic high-resolution breast MRI was performed pre and post intravenous contrast for biopsy localization purposes.  Gadavist 7 ml.     		PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:		Indications, benefits, risks and alternatives of this procedure were explained to the patient in [NAME]'s language.  Informed consent was freely given.		A medial to lateral approach was selected. Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion.   MR imaging was performed with the breast held in compression with a gridded compression paddle.		Both of the previously seen foci of enhancement were again identified on postcontrast mammogram today.  The lesion in the 9 o'clock position of left breast at middle depth is designated site 1.  Site 2 is the lesion at the 7 o'clock position at middle to posterior depth.		Site 1 (9:00) underwent biopsy first.  Local anesthesia was administered using 1% lidocaine. A short incision was made in the skin with a #11 blade. A guide sheath was applied over a trocar. A stylet was then placed in the guide sheath, and MR images were repeated to confirm accurate placement.  A handheld 9 gauge Suros biopsy probe was then advanced through the guide sheath, and a total of  12  core specimens were retrieved under vacuum assist. These were placed in formalin for pathologic analysis. An MR-compatible cylindrical first-site marker clip was then deployed through the guide sheath in the usual manner.		Identical technique was used for the biopsy at site 2 (7:00).  A total of 15 core specimens were obtained through the 19-gauge Suros probe and placed in a separate formalin vial.  A dumbbell-shaped second-site MR-compatible marker was deployed at the site in the usual manner.		Hemostasis was achieved with direct manual compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and suffered no immediate complications.		A diagnostic mammogram obtained after the procedure showed the cylindrical clip at site 1 to lie at the most lateral aspect of the biopsy cavity following release of compression.  If wider surgical excision is contemplated, a generous medial margin should be obtained in surgery.  The dumbbell-shaped marker clip at site 2, by contrast, lies at the most medial aspect of the biopsy cavity, and therefore if wider surgical excision is needed, a generous lateral margin would be appropriate.  No hematoma or other noteworthy complication is seen.		The patient was released with standard postbiopsy care instructions after a brief period of observation and will follow up with Dr. [NAME].		IMPRESSION:  		Successful MR-guided biopsy of 2 foci of abnormal enhancement in the lower inner quadrant of left breast.  A marker clip was left at each site.  Marker clip migration was noted, as discussed in detail above, and allowance for this migration should be made if wire localization and surgical excision is to be performed in future.		An addendum to this report will be generated when biopsy results are received.	     EXAM: PATHOLOGY ADDENDUM	ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]		PATHOLOGY OUTCOME SECTION:  Malignant		PATHOLOGY RESULT SECTION: MR guided biopsy results have now been received from [ADDRESS].  Accession number was SE19-04154. 		Site 1 at the 9-9:30 position of left upper inner quadrant showed proliferative fibrocystic change with no evidence of malignancy.		Site 2 at the 7 o'clock position of left lower inner quadrant showed invasive moderately differentiated lobular carcinoma of Nottingham grade 2, about 1 mm diameter.  There was also lobular carcinoma in situ involving multiple coarse, encompassing 10% of submitted biopsy material.  Microcalcifications were seen in association with lobular carcinoma in situ.  Estrogen and progesterone receptors were both positive.		Imaging and pathology findings are compatible.  Surgical excision of biopsy site 2 in the left lower inner quadrant will likely be necessary.  As noted on the original biopsy report, the dumbbell-shaped biopsy marker at the site lies medial to the target site by approximately 2-3 cm, so a generous lateral surgical margin of excision would be advisable.		RECOMMENDATION: 	1: Treatment plan Left"

ACCESSION: [ID]

HISTORY:  [AGE]-year-old woman presents for stereotactic guided core needle biopsy of indeterminate calcifications in the 9 o'clock position of the upper outer quadrant of the right breast.

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:  After informed written consent was obtained, the patient was placed in a prone position and her right breast was prepped and cleaned in a sterile fashion.  The indeterminate calcifications in the 9 o'clock position  of the right breast were then identified stereotactically and the coordinates were determined.  The area was anesthetized locally using 10 cc of 1% lidocaine.  A skin incision was made laterally through which a 9-gauge vacuum assisted biopsy device was deployed.  After the needle position was confirmed, multiple specimens were obtained.  The specimen radiograph confirmed the presence of targeted calcifications.  At the end of the procedure, a compound-shaped microclip was deployed at the biopsy site.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complication.  The specimens were labeled and sent to [ADDRESS] for analysis. 

Postprocedure mammographic views of the right breast confirmed the presence of the microclip in the expected location.  There are residual calcifications extending posteriorly, superiorly and inferiorly from the microclip.

IMPRESSION:

Stereotactic-guided core needle biopsy of indeterminate calcifications in the 9 o'clock position of the right breast.  When the pathology report becomes available, an addendum will be issued.

ACCESSION: [ID]

PATHOLOGY OUTCOME SECTION:  Malignant

PATHOLOGY RESULT SECTION:  The pathology report for the biopsy of the calcifications in the 9 o'clock position of the right breast reads ""ductal carcinoma in situ.""  Given the presence of the DCIS, surgical consultation is recommended.  There are residual calcifications throughout the lower outer quadrant of the right breast.  There is also a lymph node in the posterior third of the 9 o'clock position of the right breast which has increased in size compared to the [DATE] exam.  Given that the calcifications represent DCIS, ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy of that lymph node is recommended to exclude metastatic disease.  Prior to the biopsy, it may be prudent to perform preoperative breast MRI for the evaluation of local extent of disease and to exclude contralateral disease.

HISTORY:  Left breast calcifications and previously biopsied nodule.

COMPARISON:  [DATE], [DATE], [DATE].

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION: 

FINDINGS:

Ultrasound-guided methylene blue injection for a previous biopsy of left metastatic lymph node was performed.  The patient was prepared in the usual sterile manner.  After identifying the lymph node with the circle type clip methylene blue was injected into the site after preparing the patient in the usual sterile manner and the administration of local anesthetic.

The periareolar region was then prepared in the usual sterile manner.  Scintigraphic agent was injected in the intradermal 12 o'clock position in the periareolar region.

The patient's breast was then placed in the 90 degree lateral position within an alphanumeric grid.  After localizing the area of calcifications in the previously biopsied location, the patient was prepared in the usual sterile manner.  1% lidocaine was injected into the areas of interest.  7 cm hookwire needle was advanced into the posterior aspect of the calcifications which were being bracketed.  A 5 cm needle was advanced along the anterior margin of the abnormal calcifications.

A 7 cm hookwire needle was advanced to the area of the ribbon-shaped clip.  Confirmatory orthogonal images were obtained.  Hook wires were deployed.  Mammogram examination was obtained demonstrating the calcifications to be bracketed by the hook wires.  The thick portion of the wire is adjacent to the ribbon-shaped clip.

The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.

IMPRESSION:

Methylene blue injection of an abnormal previously biopsied left axillary lymph node.

Lymphoscintigraphy agent injection.

Bracketing of abnormal calcifications in the left upper outer quadrant.

Hookwire localization of a previous biopsy site with a ribbon clip.

SPECIMEN RADIOGRAPH:

Tissue specimens were obtained.  The initial specimen has 3 hookwires within it.  The most inferior hookwire has the clip with the ribbon shape within it.  Calcifications are identified within the tissue specimen but do extend to the edge of the specimen.  In  another specimen sample, additional calcifications are identified within it.

COMPARISON:  Mammogram and ultrasound from [DATE]

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION: Indications, benefits, risks and alternatives of this procedure were explained to the patient in [NAME]'s language.  Informed consent was freely given.

A lateral to medial approach was selected.  The targeted mass was readily localized.  Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was administered using 1% lidocaine.

A 16 ga. Bard core gun was placed adjacent to the target mass and a total of 3 core specimens were retrieved under continuous sonographic guidance. These were placed in formalin for pathologic analysis.

An MR-compatible heart-shaped Bard marker clip was then deployed through the guide needle in the usual manner.  Hemostasis was achieved with direct manual compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and suffered no immediate complications.

Using essentially identical technique, a borderline prominent right axillary lymph node with a thickened cortex was then targeted for biopsy by an oblique caudocranial approach.  1% lidocaine was used for local anesthesia.  A 16-gauge Bard core gun was used to retrieve 3 specimens of the node in question, which were placed in formalin.  A sonographically visible Twirl marker was deployed at the site.  Again, there were no immediate complications and hemostasis was achieved with direct manual compression.

A diagnostic mammogram obtained after the procedure showed the marker clip within the targeted lesion in the retroareolar right breast.  The axillary nodal clip is out of view.

The patient was released with standard postbiopsy care instructions after a brief period of observation and will follow up with Dr. [NAME].

IMPRESSION:  

Successful ultrasound-guided biopsies of a right retroareolar breast mass and a borderline prominent right axillary lymph node.  A marker clip was left at each of the 2 sides.

Bracketing preoperative wire localization was requested.		COMPARISON:  Postbiopsy mammogram of [DATE]		PROCEDURE:		Indications, benefits, risks and alternatives of this procedure were explained to the patient in [NAME]'s language.  Informed consent was freely given.		A lateral to medial approach was selected. Both of the target clips were identified on pushback view, using a fenestrated compression paddle. Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion. Local anesthesia was administered with 1% lidocaine at both target sites.		Under mammographic guidance, a 7 cm Ghiatas needle was advanced just medial to each of the 2 biopsy marker clips. Once the needle tip position was confirmed in orthogonal projections, 0.25 mL of methylene blue dye was instilled just medial to each target. Ghiatas hook wires were then deployed through each needle in the usual manner.		Post-deployment mammograms showed the more anterior X-shaped biopsy marker clip in the left lower outer quadrant lying immediately adjacent to the deepest of the 3 marker beads on the Ghiatas wire. The more posterior coil-shaped clip lay adjacent to the middle of the 3 marker beads on the corresponding Ghiatas wire.		The patient tolerated the procedure well and did not suffer any immediate complications. She was released to preop in stable condition. A hard copy film of the mammograms obtained after wire localization was printed to accompany her to surgery.		An addendum to this report will be generated when specimen radiographs and surgical pathology reports are received.		IMPRESSION:		Successful preoperative bracketing wire localization at 2 malignant biopsy sites in the left lower outer quadrant.

Informed consent was freely given.		A lateral to medial approach was selected and the marker clip and many of the remaining microcalcifications in the deep right lower outer quadrant were localized using a fenestrated compression paddle.  2-wire bracketing technique had been anticipated, but repeated attempts to pull all of the microcalcifications into the port were unsuccessful due to their proximity to the chest wall.  Therefore, a single wire technique was elected, using a 7 cm Kopans needle and hook wire.		The skin over the site was prepped in sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was administered with 1% lidocaine.  The Kopans needle was applied under mammographic guidance.  After needle position was confirmed in orthogonal projections, the hook wire was deployed through the needle without incident and the needle was withdrawn.		The post localization mammogram shows the thick collar of the Kopans wire midway between the more anteriorly located biopsy marker clip and the more posteriorly located residual microcalcifications.  A generous anterior and posterior surgical margin ought to encompass both of these structures.		There were no immediate complications.  The patient was released to preop in stable condition with printed hard copies of the post localization mammogram for intraoperative guidance.		An addendum to this report will be generated when specimen radiographs and surgical pathology results are received.		IMPRESSION:		Successful wire localization of the previous biopsy site and residual microcalcifications in the deep right lower outer quadrant.  However, bracketing technique could not be performed because of the proximity of the site to the chest wall.

COMPARISON:  Outside workup [DATE]

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION: 

FINDINGS:

Informed consent.  Procedural pause.  Standard sterile technique.  1% lidocaine locally.

Because the discordant biopsy sites, both described as 3 o'clock axis on outside workup, were not in fact very close, it was decided to localize both clips.  Wires were introduced from medial approach into the coil-shaped clip anterior and inferior, and M shaped clip more superior and posterior, respectively, representing sites of ultrasound and MR guided biopsies, deemed discordant.

Subsequently an injection of approximately 1 mCi technetium 99m labeled sulfur colloid was performed intradermally in periareolar distribution into the right breast for sentinel node localization intraoperatively.

 Subsequent specimen radiography shows both target areas to be in the surgical specimen.  Findings discussed with Dr. [NAME] in the [ADDRESS] via telephone.

EXAM: US BREAST CORE BX RT 1 SITE, MAMM POST PROCEDURE CLIP PLACEMENT RT, US BREAST RT LIMITED
ACCESSION: [ID], [ID], [ID]

HISTORY:  The patient presents today for second look ultrasound, and biopsy if needed, after a recent MR showed an enhancing nodule in the deep upper inner quadrant of right breast.  There is biopsy-proven left breast malignancy.

COMPARISON:  Breast MR from [DATE].  Mammogram and ultrasound of [DATE].

FINDINGS: Second-look ultrasound shows a hypoechoic oval nodule about 0.8 cm diameter in the 2 o'clock position of right breast 3 cm from the nipple.  This is not clearly cystic on ultrasound.  It lies close to the pectoral musculature, and was thought to potentially correspond to the enhancing nodularity deep in the right upper inner quadrant on the recent MR scan.  No spiculation or acoustic shadowing is seen.  Lung axis is parallel to the skin surface.  No other significant cystic or solid mass is visible on ultrasound in the vicinity of the MR abnormality.

PROCEDURE: Indications, benefits, risks and alternatives of this procedure were explained to the patient in [NAME]'s language.  Informed consent was freely given.

A medial to lateral approach was selected.  The subcentimeter hypoechoic nodule at the 2 o'clock position, as described above, was targeted for biopsy.  Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was administered using 1% lidocaine.

A 16 ga. Bard core gun was placed adjacent to the target mass.  A single biopsy pass under continuous sonographic guidance showed lysis of a complicated cyst, which thereafter was no longer visible as a target for biopsy.  The specimen was placed in formalin for pathologic analysis.

An MR-compatible ribbon-shaped Bard marker clip was then deployed through the guide needle in the usual manner.  Hemostasis was achieved with direct manual compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and suffered no immediate complications.

A diagnostic mammogram obtained after the procedure showed the marker clip at the 2:00 central position of right breast, at middle to posterior depth.  This appears to be too far anterior to correspond to the enhancing nodule on MR.

The patient was released with standard postbiopsy care instructions after a brief period of observation and will follow up with Dr. [NAME].

IMPRESSION:  

1.	Second-look ultrasound of the right breast showed a hypoechoic lesion 0.8 cm diameter in the 2 o'clock position 3 cm from the nipple.  This was in the general vicinity of the enhancing nodule in the deep right upper inner quadrant that was noted on the recent MR scan, and was targeted for biopsy.

2.	Ultrasound-guided core biopsy was performed.  A single pass through the targeted nodule showed lysis of a complicated cyst that can no longer be identified for further biopsies.  A single core specimen was saved for pathologic analysis.

3.	A marker clip was placed at the site.  While this is in the right upper inner quadrant at middle to posterior depth on the postbiopsy mammogram, it appears to lie too far anterior to correspond to the enhancing nodule adjoining the chest wall on the MR scan.  The MR lesion does not show any corresponding abnormality on mammogram or ultrasound, not even on a repeat sonogram targeted to the area that was performed today by the ultrasound technologist and radiologist together.  The options for imaging-guided biopsy of this abnormality are currently exhausted, and there does not appear to be any palpable abnormality either.  A short interval follow-up breast MR could be performed to establish stability.

4.	An addendum to this report will be generated when biopsy results are received.

EXAM: ULTRASOUND GUIDED BIOPSY LEFT BREAST WITH CLIP
ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]

HISTORY:  [AGE]-year-old woman presents for ultrasound guided core needle biopsy of  a hypoechoic lesion in the 9 o'clock position of the left breast.

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION: Prior to the procedure, the previous imaging dated [DATE], [DATE] and [DATE] was reviewed.  In the 9 o'clock position of the left breast, there is an irregular hypoechoic lesion corresponding to the area of distortion on the mammogram and enhancement noted on the MRI.  Repeat imaging of the retroareolar region of the left breast by both the technologist and myself failed to reproduce the nodule questioned on the [DATE] exam.  The nodule is likely related to nipple shadowing.  This is further supported by the fact that no abnormal enhancement is seen within the region on the MRI.

After informed written consent was obtained, the patient's left breast was prepped and cleaned in a sterile fashion.  The hypoechoic lesion in the 9 o'clock position of the left breast was identified sonographically.  The area was anesthetized locally using 10 cc of 1% lidocaine.  A skin incision was made inferolaterally through which an introducer was placed and 4  samples were obtained using a 16-gauge Bard core needle biopsy device under ultrasound guidance.  At the end of the procedure, a ribbon-shaped microclip was deployed at the biopsy site.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complication.  The specimens were labelled and sent to [ADDRESS] for analysis.

Post procedure mammographic views of the left breast confirmed the presence of the microclip in the expected location.  

IMPRESSION:

Ultrasound guided core needle biopsy of a hypoechoic lesion in the 9 o'clock position of the left breast.  When the pathology report becomes available, an addendum will be issued.

EXAM: RIGHT BREAST NEEDLE LOCALIZATION WITH SENTINEL INJECTION	ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]		HISTORY:  Invasive ductal carcinoma, 12 o'clock position of right breast 5 cm from the nipple		COMPARISON:  Ultrasound-guided biopsy and postbiopsy mammogram from [DATE] at Solis.		PROCEDURE:		Indications, benefits, risks and alternatives of this procedure were explained to the patient in [NAME]'s language.  Informed consent was freely given.		A lateral to medial approach was selected.  The ribbon clip at the 12:00 middle to posterior position of right breast was readily identified on mammography, using a fenestrated compression paddle.  Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was administered with 1% lidocaine.		The site was localized using a 9 cm Kopans needle.  After needle tip position was confirmed in orthogonal projections, 0.25 mL of methylene blue dye was instilled to mark the site.  A Kopans hookwire was then deployed through the needle in the usual manner without significant difficulty.  The targeted marker clip lies immediately adjacent to the deepest aspect of the thick collar of the Kopans wire.		Using sterile technique, 1.4 mCi of technetium-99m sulfur colloid was then injected intradermally and subcutaneously in the periareolar right breast.  The dose was divided into 4 injection sites to bracket the nipple on all sides.  Scintigraphic imaging was not requested or performed.  Intraoperative sentinel lymph node localization will be carried out by the attending surgeon using a handheld gamma probe.		The patient suffered a vasovagal reaction during the procedure, but recovered promptly without further complications.  She was released to preop in stable condition.  Film copies of the mammograms were printed and marked to accompany her to surgery.		An addendum to this report will be dictated when specimen radiographs and surgical pathology results are received.		IMPRESSION:		1.	Successful wire localization of the ribbon-shaped marker clip at the site of biopsy-proven malignancy in the 12:00 middle to posterior position right breast.  Methylene blue dye was instilled at the site, per Dr. [NAME]'s preferences.		2.	Successful periareolar intradermal and subcutaneous sulfur colloid injection in the right breast for subsequent intraoperative sentinel lymph node localization.		Dosage: 1.4 mCi Tc-99m Filtered Sulfur Colloid intradermal admin			     EXAM: PATHOLOGY ADDENDUM	ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]		PATHOLOGY OUTCOME SECTION:  Malignant		PATHOLOGY RESULT SECTION: Surgical pathology results following wire localization and surgical excision have now been received from [ADDRESS].  Accession number was [ID].		Specimen radiographs acquired at Honor Health during surgery showed both of the biopsy marker clips that were previously present in the right breast.  There was potential tumor involvement of the anterolateral margin.  Dr. [NAME] was notified of these findings during surgery.		Specimen A consisted of 3 right axillary sentinel lymph nodes, all of which were negative for metastatic carcinoma.		Specimen B was the primary lumpectomy.  It showed invasive ductal carcinoma of overall grade 1, measuring 21 mm maximal diameter.  There was no ductal carcinoma in situ or lobular carcinoma in situ.  No lymphovascular invasion was observed.  The anterior margin showed unifocal involvement.  The remaining margins were negative by 2 mm or greater.		Specimen C was an additional sample acquired from the anterolateral margin of the surgical bed.

HISTORY:  [AGE]-year-old woman presents for ultrasound guided core needle biopsy of  a prominent right axillary lymph node, hypoechoic shadowing in the 12 o'clock position of the right breast and a nodule in the 9 o'clock position of the right breast.

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:  After informed written consent was obtained, the patient's right breast was prepped and cleaned in a sterile fashion.  Attention was first directed to the 9 o'clock position.  The hypoechoic nodule in the 9 o'clock position of the right breast was identified sonographically.  The area was anesthetized locally using 8 cc of 1% lidocaine.  A skin incision was made laterally through which an introducer was placed and 3  samples were obtained using a 14-gauge Bard core needle biopsy device under ultrasound guidance.  At the end of the procedure, a ribbon-shaped microclip was deployed at the biopsy site.

Attention was then directed to the 12 o'clock position of the right breast.  The hypoechoic shadowing in the 12 o'clock position of the right breast was identified sonographically.  The area was anesthetized locally using 8 cc of 1% lidocaine.  A skin incision was made laterally through which an introducer was placed and 3  samples were obtained using a 14-gauge Bard core needle biopsy device under ultrasound guidance.  At the end of the procedure, a winged shaped microclip was deployed at the biopsy site.  

A representative prominent right axillary lymph node was then identified sonographically.  The area was anesthetized locally using 6 cc of 1% lidocaine.  A skin incision was made inferolaterally through which an introducer was placed and 2  samples were obtained using a 16-gauge Bard core needle biopsy device under ultrasound guidance.  At the end of the procedure, a twirl shaped microclip was deployed at the biopsy site. 

The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complication.  The specimens were labelled and sent to [ADDRESS] for analysis.

Post procedure mammographic views of the right breast confirmed the presence of the microclips in the expected locations.

HISTORY:  Bilateral breast nodularities

COMPARISON:  Screening mammograms of [DATE]. Diagnostic mammogram and bilateral breast ultrasound from [DATE]. Bilateral breast MR dated [DATE].

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION: Indications, benefits, risks and alternatives of this procedure were explained to the patient in [NAME]'s language.  Informed consent was freely given. The patient states that she has both hemophilia and von Willebrand's syndrome, and her hematologist has arranged for her to have an infusion of coagulation factors both before and after this procedure. She understands that she is at significantly higher than usual risk for hemorrhage after the procedure.

An irregularly marginated nodule with some acoustic shadowing is again seen at the 9:30 to 10 o'clock position 7 cm from the nipple, and was targeted for biopsy first. It is designated site 1 on the postbiopsy mammograms. A lateral to medial approach was selected.  The targeted mass was readily localized.  Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was administered using Carbocaine due to a lidocaine allergy.

A 16 ga. Bard Marquis core gun was placed adjacent to the target mass and a total of 2 core specimens were retrieved under continuous sonographic guidance. These were placed in formalin for pathologic analysis.

An MR-compatible ribbon-shaped Bard marker clip was then deployed through the guide needle in the usual manner.  Hemostasis was achieved with direct manual compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and suffered no hemorrhage or other immediate complications.

Using identical technique, a lobulated hypoechoic solid mass in the 12:30 position of right breast 2 cm from the nipple was then targeted for biopsy. Again, Carbocaine was used for local anesthesia due to a lidocaine allergy. 2 core specimens were retrieved under ultrasound guidance using a 16-gauge Bard Marquis core gun and placed in formalin. These were rather frangible, and may reflect viscous cyst contents. A wing-shaped MR-compatible marker clip was then deployed at the site without incident and no hemorrhage or other significant complication was observed.

On the left side, the patient has a 1.7 cm hypoechoic lesion at the 2 o'clock position of left breast 6 cm in the nipple, indeterminate for a complicated cyst or a hypoechoic solid mass. This was targeted for biopsy using a 16-gauge Bard Marquis core gun and technique identical to that described above, using a lateral to medial approach. 2 core specimens were retrieved and placed in formalin, and a ribbon-shaped MR-compatible marker clip was deployed at the site. Again, there was no hemorrhage or other significant complication and the patient tolerated the procedure well.

A diagnostic mammogram obtained after the procedure showed the ribbon clip at site 1 in the right upper outer quadrant, corresponding to the most irregular of the multiple indistinct nodularities in the vicinity. A wing clip at site 2 lies within the dominant mass seen here previously in the upper inner quadrant at middle depth. On the left, the ribbon marker lies in the upper outer quadrant amidst several of the large simple cysts noted on prior imaging. One of the smaller nodules, which previously measured about 1.5 cm diameter at the site of the clip, has involuted on the current exam, suggesting cyst lysis. No significant hematoma or other noteworthy complication is seen.

The patient was released with standard postbiopsy care instructions after a brief period of observation and will follow up with Dr. [NAME].

IMPRESSION:  

Successful ultrasound-guided biopsy of 2 masses on the right and one on the left.  A marker clip was left at each site.

An addendum to this report will be generated when biopsy results are received.

Note that the MR images also show 2 enhancing lesions in the left breast that are not related to the lesion that underwent biopsy today. MR guided biopsy should still be considered. The 2 biopsies performed today on the right-hand side correlate well with the enhancing masses that were seen on MR.

Specimen A on the [ADDRESS] report is from the solid nodule at the 12-12 30 anterior position of right breast, which is designated site 2 on the biopsy procedure report.  It showed a fibroepithelial lesion, nonspecific for fibroadenoma or benign phyllodes tumor.  There is no evidence for atypia or malignancy.  Wider surgical excision would be recommended to exclude a phyllodes lesion.

Specimen B on the pathology report corresponds to the shadowing irregular solid nodule in the 9:30-10 o'clock position of right breast, 7 cm from the nipple, which was designated site 1 on the biopsy procedure report.  This lesion shows invasive ductal carcinoma at least 0.8 cm diameter.  There was no evidence of vascular or lymphatic invasion, ductal carcinoma in situ, or lobular carcinoma in situ.  Estrogen and progesterone receptors and HER-2/neu assay are still pending.  Treatment plan is needed and MR should be considered for local and regional staging.

Specimen C on the pathology report is from the suspected complicated cyst at the 2 o'clock position of left breast 6 cm from the nipple.  This is the third of the 3 lesions that underwent biopsy.  It shows benign breast tissue with usual ductal hyperplasia and duct filled with macrophages.  There was no atypia, in situ carcinoma, or invasive carcinoma.  Imaging and pathology findings are concordant.  This lesion can be followed at annual screening mammography.

EXAM: ULTRASOUND-GUIDED LEFT BREAST CORE BIOPSY
ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]

HISTORY:  The patient has biopsy-proven right breast cancer. She has had a single previous left breast biopsy with ultrasound guidance at the 2:00 position which showed negative results for breast cancer. A ribbon clip was placed at this site. She was scheduled today for a an ultrasound-guided core biopsy of a 7:00 nodule, seen on prior MRI and outside second look ultrasound. She was also scheduled for an MR guided core biopsy of an 8 mm faintly enhancing nodule based on the prior MRI in the lower outer quadrant. The ultrasound-guided core biopsy was performed today, but the MR guided left breast biopsy was canceled. Please see the report of the canceled MRI exam. 

COMPARISON:  MRI of both breasts dated [DATE]. 2 core biopsies of the right breast and one core biopsy of the left breast on [DATE]. 

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:

Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with the patient who understands and agrees.  Consent was obtained.  Ultrasound was used to identify the abnormality at the 7:00 position left breast, 5 cm from the nipple.  Sterile prep and drape.  Lidocaine local anesthesia. A  2 mm skin incision was made.  4 passes were made through the lesion with a 16-gauge Bard Marquee biopsy gun.  Specimens were placed in  formalin and sent to [ADDRESS].  No complications were noted during or immediately following the procedure. A wing clip was successfully deployed.  Post procedure mammogram shows the clip in good position as well as showing the previously placed ribbon clip at the 2:00 position in the left upper outer quadrant.

ACCESSION: [ID], [ID], [ID], [ID]

HISTORY:  Bilateral breast nodularities

COMPARISON:  Screening mammograms of [DATE]. Diagnostic mammogram and bilateral breast ultrasound from [DATE]. Bilateral breast MR dated [DATE].

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION: Indications, benefits, risks and alternatives of this procedure were explained to the patient in [NAME]'s language.  Informed consent was freely given. The patient states that she has both hemophilia and von Willebrand's syndrome, and her hematologist has arranged for her to have an infusion of coagulation factors both before and after this procedure. She understands that she is at significantly higher than usual risk for hemorrhage after the procedure.

An irregularly marginated nodule with some acoustic shadowing is again seen at the 9:30 to 10 o'clock position 7 cm from the nipple, and was targeted for biopsy first. It is designated site 1 on the postbiopsy mammograms. A lateral to medial approach was selected.  The targeted mass was readily localized.  Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was administered using Carbocaine due to a lidocaine allergy.

A 16 ga. Bard Marquis core gun was placed adjacent to the target mass and a total of 2 core specimens were retrieved under continuous sonographic guidance. These were placed in formalin for pathologic analysis.

An MR-compatible ribbon-shaped Bard marker clip was then deployed through the guide needle in the usual manner.  Hemostasis was achieved with direct manual compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and suffered no hemorrhage or other immediate complications.

Using identical technique, a lobulated hypoechoic solid mass in the 12:30 position of right breast 2 cm from the nipple was then targeted for biopsy. Again, Carbocaine was used for local anesthesia due to a lidocaine allergy. 2 core specimens were retrieved under ultrasound guidance using a 16-gauge Bard Marquis core gun and placed in formalin. These were rather frangible, and may reflect viscous cyst contents. A wing-shaped MR-compatible marker clip was then deployed at the site without incident and no hemorrhage or other significant complication was observed.

On the left side, the patient has a 1.7 cm hypoechoic lesion at the 2 o'clock position of left breast 6 cm in the nipple, indeterminate for a complicated cyst or a hypoechoic solid mass. This was targeted for biopsy using a 16-gauge Bard Marquis core gun and technique identical to that described above, using a lateral to medial approach. 2 core specimens were retrieved and placed in formalin, and a ribbon-shaped MR-compatible marker clip was deployed at the site. Again, there was no hemorrhage or other significant complication and the patient tolerated the procedure well.

A diagnostic mammogram obtained after the procedure showed the ribbon clip at site 1 in the right upper outer quadrant, corresponding to the most irregular of the multiple indistinct nodularities in the vicinity. A wing clip at site 2 lies within the dominant mass seen here previously in the upper inner quadrant at middle depth. On the left, the ribbon marker lies in the upper outer quadrant amidst several of the large simple cysts noted on prior imaging. One of the smaller nodules, which previously measured about 1.5 cm diameter at the site of the clip, has involuted on the current exam, suggesting cyst lysis. No significant hematoma or other noteworthy complication is seen.

The patient was released with standard postbiopsy care instructions after a brief period of observation and will follow up with Dr. [NAME].

IMPRESSION:  

Successful ultrasound-guided biopsy of 2 masses on the right and one on the left.  A marker clip was left at each site.

An addendum to this report will be generated when biopsy results are received.

Note that the MR images also show 2 enhancing lesions in the left breast that are not related to the lesion that underwent biopsy today. MR guided biopsy should still be considered. The 2 biopsies performed today on the right-hand side correlate well with the enhancing masses that were seen on MR.

FINDINGS:

Pertinent imaging was reviewed, confirming the target location of the right breast mass at 11-12 o'clock, 2 cm from the nipple as well as right axilla.

The procedure, including risks, benefits, alternatives, was discussed with the patient. All questions were answered. Informed written and vertebral consent was obtained.

The area in question was again imaged under ultrasound. The skin was then dressed and draped in the standard sterile fashion. Approximately 5 mL of 1% lidocaine was administered into the skin. A small incision was made. Under ultrasound guidance, a 16-gauge coaxial biopsy device was inserted into the breast. Multiple specimens were obtained. Under ultrasound guidance, a ribbon-shaped biopsy clip was then placed at the site. Hemostasis was achieved through compression. The skin was dressed in a clean fashion.

The same procedure was then performed in the right axilla. Approximately 5 mL of 1% lidocaine was administered into the skin. A small incision was made. Under ultrasound guidance, an 18-gauge biopsy device was inserted into the breast. Multiple specimens were obtained. Under ultrasound guidance, a twirl-shaped biopsy clip was then placed at the site. Hemostasis was achieved through compression. The skin was dressed in a clean fashion.


Post biopsy craniocaudal and lateral views demonstrate the ribbon-shaped biopsy clip at the target location.

The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication. She was given postbiopsy care instructions. She left the department in stable condition.

EXAM: ULTRASOUND GUIDED BIOPSY LEFT BREAST WITH CLIP	ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]		HISTORY:  [AGE]-year-old woman presents for ultrasound guided core needle biopsy of  a hypoechoic nodule in the 11 to 12 o'clock position of the upper inner quadrant of the left breast.		PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION: Prior to the procedure, ultrasound of the upper left breast was performed.  There is an irregular hypoechoic nodule in the left 12 o'clock position of the left breast, 5 cm from the nipple.  This is felt to correlate with the asymmetry noted on the mammogram.  So was decided to target this for the biopsy.		After informed written consent was obtained, the patient's left breast was prepped and cleaned in a sterile fashion.  The hypoechoic nodule in the 11 to 12 o'clock position of the left breast was identified sonographically.  The area was anesthetized locally using 5 cc of 1% lidocaine.  A skin incision was made laterally through which an introducer was placed and 3  samples were obtained using a 16-gauge Bard core needle biopsy device under ultrasound guidance.  At the end of the procedure, a ribbon-shaped microclip was deployed at the biopsy site.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complication.  The specimens were labelled and sent to [ADDRESS] for analysis.		Post procedure mammographic views of the left breast confirmed the presence of the microclip in the expected location.  		IMPRESSION:		Ultrasound guided core needle biopsy of a hypoechoic nodule in the 11 to 12 o'clock position of the left breast.  When the pathology report becomes available, an addendum will be issued.  		   	     EXAM: Pathology Addendum 	ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]		PATHOLOGY OUTCOME SECTION:  Malignant		PATHOLOGY RESULT SECTION:  The pathology report for the biopsy of the lesion in the 11 to 12 o'clock position of the left breast reads ""invasive mammary carcinoma, no special type; atypical ductal hyperplasia.""  Both the estrogen and progesterone receptor results are positive.		Given this MALIGNANT histopathologic diagnosis, surgical consultation is recommended.		In certain clinical scenarios, patients with biopsy proven malignancy may benefit from preoperative breast MRI for the evaluation of local extent of disease and to exclude contralateral disease.    		RECOMMENDATION: 	1: Treatment plan Left"

HISTORY:  MR guided biopsy of a focus of enhancement in the central left breast showed invasive ductal carcinoma and atypical hyperplasia.

COMPARISON:  MR guided biopsy and postbiopsy mammogram from [DATE].

PROCEDURE:

Indications, benefits, risks and alternatives of this procedure were explained to the patient in [NAME]'s language.  Informed consent was freely given.

A lateral to medial approach was selected.  The biopsy marker clip at the 2-3 o'clock middle position near the center of left breast was readily localized using a fenestrated compression paddle.  Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion and anesthetized with 1% lidocaine.

A 7 cm Kopans needle was advanced past the marker clip under mammographic guidance.  After the tip position was confirmed in orthogonal projections, a hookwire was deployed through the needle in the usual manner without significant difficulty.

Using sterile technique, 1 millicurie of technetium-99m sulfur colloid was then administered intradermally and subcutaneously in the periareolar left breast, dividing the dose into 4 injection sites bracketing the nipple.  Scintigraphic imaging was not requested or performed.  Intraoperative sentinel lymph node localization will be carried out by the attending surgeon with a handheld gamma probe.

There were no immediate complications and the patient was released to preop in stable condition.

IMPRESSION:

1.	Successful preoperative wire localization of the biopsy site in the left upper outer quadrant near the center of the left breast.

2.	Successful periareolar technetium-99m sulfur colloid administration for intraoperative sentinel lymph node localization.

EXAM: STEREOTACTIC-GUIDED VACUUM-ASSISTED RIGHT BREAST BIOPSY
ACCESSION: [ID]

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:

HISTORY:  [AGE]-year-old woman presents for stereotactic guided core needle biopsy of indeterminate calcifications in the 11:00 position, upper outer quadrant, of the right breast.

PROCEDURE:  After informed written consent was obtained, the patient was placed in a prone position and her right breast was prepped and cleaned in a sterile fashion.  The indeterminate calcifications in the 11:00 position  of the right breast were then identified stereotactically and the coordinates were determined.  The area was anesthetized locally using 9 cc of 1% lidocaine.  A skin incision was made superior through which a 9-gauge vacuum assisted biopsy device was deployed.  After the needle position was confirmed, multiple specimens were obtained.  The specimen radiograph confirmed the presence of targeted calcifications.  At the end of the procedure, a microclip was deployed at the biopsy site.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complication.  The specimens were labeled and sent to [ADDRESS] for analysis. 

Postprocedure mammographic views of the right breast confirmed the presence of the microclip in the expected location.  

IMPRESSION:

Stereotactic-guided core needle biopsy of indeterminate calcifications in the 11:00 position, upper outer quadrant, of the right breast.  When the pathology report becomes available, an addendum will be issued.  

   

   


     EXAM: Pathology Addendum 
ACCESSION: [ID]

PATHOLOGY OUTCOME SECTION:  Malignant

PATHOLOGY RESULT SECTION:  Right breast 11 o'clock upper outer quadrant biopsy demonstrates invasive lobular carcinoma.  Ductal carcinoma in situ is also present.  Estrogen receptor positive at 90%.  Progesterone receptors are also positive at 90%.  Malignant concordant.  Recommend surgical and oncologic consultation. In certain clinical scenarios, patients with biopsy proven malignancy may benefit from preoperative breast MRI for the evaluation of local extent of disease and to exclude contralateral disease.
