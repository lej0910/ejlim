2D digital mammography with 3D tomosynthesis was performed.  There has been interval development of 2 separate groupings of pleomorphic microcalcifications in the right upper outer quadrant project about 2 cm apart.  Magnification images in a true lateral were performed.  The microcalcifications are indeterminate and are bothersome enough to require biopsy.  Otherwise,   I see no dominant mass, skin thickening, nipple retraction, or pathologic grouped microcalcifications elsewhere in either breast.  There are no axillary lymph nodes identified.



IMPRESSION:



2 separate groupings of indeterminate microcalcifications in the right upper outer quadrant.  Stereotactic biopsy of both is recommended.

FINDINGS:     2D digital mammography with 3D breast tomosynthesis was performed.  A marker lies on the skin surface at the site of palpable abnormality in the left upper outer quadrant at middle depth.  Subjacent to the marker, there is a large new lobulated mass, or quite possibly multifocal adjacent masses, with an overall diameter of approximately 6.5 x 4.4 x 7.7 cm.  The margins are indistinct and irregular, with possible mild spiculation in a few locations.  Innumerable highly suspicious pleomorphic microcalcifications are seen throughout the mass or masses.  A spot view of the axillary palpable abnormality was attempted, but the lesion cannot be pulled into view.  The remainder of the left breast and the entire right breast are of benign stable appearance, with a few benign rounded and atherosclerotic calcifications.  There is a skin mole in the upper right breast.    Complete left breast ultrasound examination was performed, encompassing all 4 quadrants, nipple, and axilla.  On the sonogram it appears that there is a primary malignant solid mass of about 4.2 x 2.7 x 4.5 cm, showing microlobulated and angular borders, centered at the 2 o'clock position of left breast 5 cm from the nipple.  This correlates well with the palpable abnormality pointed out by the patient.  Many echogenic foci within are consistent with the suspicious microcalcifications noted on the mammogram.  In addition, there are at least 3 other satellite nodules of identical imaging appearance that lie immediately adjacent to the primary mass in the same quadrant.  The largest of these is at the 3 o'clock position 4 cm from the nipple, measuring about 1.8 cm diameter.  In the left axilla there is matted adenopathy, with complete loss of normal lymph node morphology.  The largest individual nodal mass is approximately 10.1 x 6.2 x 7.0 cm.    IMPRESSION:    1. Multifocal solid masses in the left upper outer quadrant, corresponding to the palpable abnormality.  The dominant mass is 4.5 cm maximal diameter and its satellite nodules in the same quadrant range up to 1.8 cm.  Many highly suspicious pleomorphic microcalcifications are present within.  Findings are practically certain to be primary breast carcinoma, and tissue diagnosis is required for further evaluation.    2. Bulky, matted left axillary adenopathy.  The appearance is highly consistent with regional lymph node metastasis from the primary tumor in the left breast.  Again, tissue diagnosis is advised.    3.

She also reports a new palpable abnormality in the anterior left upper outer quadrant.    COMPARISON: Diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound of right breast dated [DATE].  Bilateral screening mammograms of [DATE] and [DATE].    Breast Density: The breast parenchyma is composed of scattered fibroglandular densities.    FINDINGS:     2D digital mammography with 3D breast tomosynthesis was performed.  Surgical scar in the retroareolar right breast is not grossly changed.  Lateral to the scar by approximately 3 cm, there is an oblong nodular asymmetric density with irregular margins that measures about 0.9 cm.  This seems to be the same as the nodularity noted in [DATE], at which time it was about 0.8 cm to my measurement.  It is not well seen on oblique or straight lateral projections.  On the tomographic images, it has a somewhat spiculated margin (CC view, slice 64 of 77), and appears to lie in the lower outer quadrant.  Right breast is otherwise unchanged and unremarkable.    The patient also has a new palpable abnormality in the anterior left upper outer quadrant, denoted by a marker on the skin surface.  Subjacent to this there are multiple new nodules with indistinct margins, the largest of which is approximately 1.7 cm diameter at the 2 to 3 o'clock position of left breast near the junction of the middle and anterior zones.  There is a retroareolar nodularity located quite superficially at the 1 to 2 o'clock position, immediately subjacent to the skin marker, measuring about 0.8 cm.  At least 3 other new subcentimeter nodularities are visible in the same vicinity, and perhaps as many as 6.  On the tomographic images, there are some areas of suspected mild spiculation and/or architectural distortion adjoining these multiple new nodules.  The left breast is otherwise unchanged and unremarkable.    Sonography in the retroareolar right breast shows stable scarring.  About 3 to 4 cm lateral to the scar, at the 8 to 9 o'clock position anterior of right breast, there is a second ill-defined hypoechoic nodularity that could also be scar tissue, approximately 0.7 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm diameter.  It is oriented with its long axis parallel to the skin surface, but does not extend all the way to the dermis.  It shows dense acoustic shadowing.  On the older sonogram from [DATE], the same structure appeared to measure about 0.5 x 0.2 x 0.3 cm, with a lesser degree of acoustic shadowing.  This is a potentially significant interim change, and therefore, tissue diagnosis of this lesion would be advised.  Visible portions of the right breast are otherwise unchanged and unremarkable, with no other discrete mass, distortion, shadowing or adenopathy.    In the left breast, corresponding to the area of new palpable abnormality pointed out by the patient in the anterior left upper outer quadrant, there are multiple new solid masses.  One of the largest of these is about 1.7 x 1.0 x 1.2 cm diameter in the 2 o'clock position of left breast, 2 to 4 cm from the nipple.  It shows angular borders and some inconsistent the visualized acoustic shadowing.  Another noteworthy nodule is a superficial hypoechoic mass in the immediate retroareolar left upper outer quadrant, corresponding to the palpable abnormality at the approximate 1 o'clock position, measuring 0.5 x 0.4 cm.  This is of low echogenicity, but shows internal blood flow, and appears to be a solid mass with mildly irregular borders.  Both of these lesions should undergo tissue diagnosis and are amenable to ultrasound-guided core biopsy.  There are at least 3 other subcentimeter hypoechoic nodules of similar irregularly marginated appearance in the vicinity, the largest of which is about 0.6 cm diameter just peripheral to the dominant 1.7 cm mass at the 2 o'clock position.  These could be satellite nodularities in a case of multifocal malignancy.  In the other quadrants of the left breast, no other discrete cystic or solid mass is seen.  There is no other acoustic shadowing, distortion, axillary adenopathy or other evidence of malignancy.    IMPRESSION:    1. The asymmetric density in the anterolateral right breast on mammogram is slightly larger than last year, and seems to correspond to an enlarging and rather suspicious suspicious solid mass in the right lower outer quadrant at anterior depth on the sonogram.  This is lateral to the patient's previous surgical scar, which is otherwise stable.  It is possible that there is worsening scar tissue at this location, but neoplasm is impossible to exclude and tissue diagnosis is recommended.  It is quite amenable to ultrasound-guided core biopsy.    2. The new palpable abnormality pointed out by the patient in the anterior left upper outer quadrant corresponds to multiple suspicious new solid masses of up to 1.7 cm diameter on the mammogram and ultrasound.  The appearance is quite suspicious for multifocal malignancy.  2 of the dominant nodules, one located at the 2 o'clock position at middle to anterior depth, and the other in the superficial periareolar 1-2:00 position, should undergo tissue diagnosis.  Again, these are amenable to ultrasound-guided core biopsy, and we would be pleased to provide this service upon request.

About 3 to 4 cm lateral to the scar, at the 8 to 9 o'clock position anterior of right breast, there is a second ill-defined hypoechoic nodularity that could also be scar tissue, approximately 0.7 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm diameter.  It is oriented with its long axis parallel to the skin surface, but does not extend all the way to the dermis.  It shows dense acoustic shadowing.  On the older sonogram from [DATE], the same structure appeared to measure about 0.5 x 0.2 x 0.3 cm, with a lesser degree of acoustic shadowing.  This is a potentially significant interim change, and therefore, tissue diagnosis of this lesion would be advised.  Visible portions of the right breast are otherwise unchanged and unremarkable, with no other discrete mass, distortion, shadowing or adenopathy.    In the left breast, corresponding to the area of new palpable abnormality pointed out by the patient in the anterior left upper outer quadrant, there are multiple new solid masses.  One of the largest of these is about 1.7 x 1.0 x 1.2 cm diameter in the 2 o'clock position of left breast, 2 to 4 cm from the nipple.  It shows angular borders and some inconsistent the visualized acoustic shadowing.  Another noteworthy nodule is a superficial hypoechoic mass in the immediate retroareolar left upper outer quadrant, corresponding to the palpable abnormality at the approximate 1 o'clock position, measuring 0.5 x 0.4 cm.  This is of low echogenicity, but shows internal blood flow, and appears to be a solid mass with mildly irregular borders.  Both of these lesions should undergo tissue diagnosis and are amenable to ultrasound-guided core biopsy.  There are at least 3 other subcentimeter hypoechoic nodules of similar irregularly marginated appearance in the vicinity, the largest of which is about 0.6 cm diameter just peripheral to the dominant 1.7 cm mass at the 2 o'clock position.  These could be satellite nodularities in a case of multifocal malignancy.  In the other quadrants of the left breast, no other discrete cystic or solid mass is seen.  There is no other acoustic shadowing, distortion, axillary adenopathy or other evidence of malignancy.    IMPRESSION:    1. The asymmetric density in the anterolateral right breast on mammogram is slightly larger than last year, and seems to correspond to an enlarging and rather suspicious suspicious solid mass in the right lower outer quadrant at anterior depth on the sonogram.  This is lateral to the patient's previous surgical scar, which is otherwise stable.  It is possible that there is worsening scar tissue at this location, but neoplasm is impossible to exclude and tissue diagnosis is recommended.  It is quite amenable to ultrasound-guided core biopsy.    2. The new palpable abnormality pointed out by the patient in the anterior left upper outer quadrant corresponds to multiple suspicious new solid masses of up to 1.7 cm diameter on the mammogram and ultrasound.  The appearance is quite suspicious for multifocal malignancy.  2 of the dominant nodules, one located at the 2 o'clock position at middle to anterior depth, and the other in the superficial periareolar 1-2:00 position, should undergo tissue diagnosis.  Again, these are amenable to ultrasound-guided core biopsy, and we would be pleased to provide this service upon request.

COMPARISON: [DATE], [DATE].



Breast Density: The breast parenchyma is composed of scattered fibroglandular densities.



FINDINGS: 



2D digital mammography with 3D breast tomosynthesis was performed.  There is increased left nipple retraction when compared to the prior films.  There are retroareolar densities and distortion identified mammographically.  Benign type vascular calcifications identified.



Complete bilateral breast ultrasound was obtained, evaluating all four quadrants, the retroareolar region and axilla. Color and doppler imaging was also used on focal lesions.  In the right retroareolar breast there is a spiculated mass identified measuring 10 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm in size.  This is suspicious.  Further evaluation with tissue sampling is recommended.



In the left retroareolar breast there is a spiculated mass identified measuring 1.4 x 0.6 x 0.9 cm in size.  Further evaluation with tissue sampling is recommended.  Approximately 2.5 cm from the areola at approximately the 6 o'clock position there is a possible satellite nodule measuring 4 mm.  In addition at the 2 o'clock position approximately 2 cm from the nipple there is a vague hypoechoic density which could also represent an additional satellite nodule.



The axillae appear within normal limits bilaterally with no evidence of abnormal lymphadenopathy.



The findings were briefly discussed with the patient.  A voicemail was left for the clinical care team as the care team was not available at the time of the phone call.





IMPRESSION:



Suspicious right retroareolar breast mass.  Further evaluation with tissue sampling is recommended.  This can be performed with ultrasound-guided core biopsy.



Suspicious left retroareolar mass with probable satellite nodules at the 6 o'clock and 2 o'clock positions.  Further evaluation with tissue sampling is recommended.  This can also be performed with ultrasound guided core biopsy.

	COMPARISON: None.  Baseline study
	
	Breast Density: The breast parenchyma is heterogeneously dense which may obscure small masses.
	
	FINDINGS: 
	
	2D digital mammography with 3D breast tomosynthesis was performed.  Despite global asymmetry and very dense tissue throughout all quadrants bilaterally, there is a slightly more ovoid and denser area of breast tissue occupying much of the upper outer right breast spanning at least 7 cm.  There is no definable distortion mammographically.  No suspicious calcifications.  There is a smaller area of nodular asymmetry immediately underlying the BB marker on the skin, denoting lump, measuring only 13 mm or so diameter.
	
	Because the patient's right breast palpable findings, high risk status, and global asymmetry, whole breast ultrasound bilaterally was subsequently performed. Complete bilateral breast ultrasound was obtained, evaluating all four quadrants, the retroareolar region and axilla. Color and doppler imaging was also used on focal lesions.
	
	On the right, there is a 13 mm mass with partially obscured margins only 5 mm or so from the skin surface at the 10 o'clock position corresponding to palpable lump.  There is a broader shadowing area underlying this exam in 5 cm diameter, which is less masslike but is denser and more shadowing than any tissue in the other quadrants bilaterally.  The disc, even though the larger area is difficult to discretely defined or measurable, the smaller palpable lump is concerning for the ""tip of the iceberg"" of a much larger/broader lesion in the upper outer quadrant.  No other definable/measurable masses are seen in either breast bilaterally.  No axillary adenopathy sonographically.

HISTORY:  Screening.



COMPARISON: [DATE], screening mammogram performed at [ADDRESS]. [DATE], screening mammogram performed at [ADDRESS]. 



TECHNIQUE: Bilateral 2D screening digital mammography with 3D tomosynthesis was performed and compared.



Breast Density: The breast parenchyma is heterogeneously dense which limits the sensitivity of mammography.



FINDINGS:  Focal asymmetry in the left lower inner quadrant.  Therefore, the patient should return for additional images of the left breast to include spot compression views in the appropriate projections, a true lateral, and consideration for ultrasound if the area persists.  Otherwise, I do not see any evidence of dominant mass, skin thickening, nipple retraction or pathologic clustered microcalcifications.      There are a few normal-appearing bilateral axillary lymph nodes.



IMPRESSION:



Additional images are requested as detailed in the body of the report above.

	Breast Density: The breast parenchyma is heterogeneously dense which may obscure small masses.
	
	FINDINGS: 
	
	2D digital mammography with 3D breast tomosynthesis was performed.  In the area of palpable abnormality there is a masslike lesion identified with faint pleomorphic calcifications.  Adjacent to this lesion closer to the axilla there is a second lesion which is spiculated worrisome for a satellite nodule.  However, closer to the nipple in the lower outer quadrant there is another mass with pleomorphic calcifications.  There also appears to be ductal extension of pleomorphic calcifications from this lesion closer to the nipple.
	
	The right breast appears unremarkable mammographically.
	
	Complete bilateral breast ultrasound was obtained, evaluating all four quadrants, the retroareolar region and axilla. Color and doppler imaging was also used on focal lesions.  In the area of palpable abnormality there is a suspicious appearing spiculated mass with central calcifications measuring 1.6 cm in size at approximately 2:30 position 7 cm from the nipple.  Approximately 1 cm distal to this lesion there is a satellite nodule measuring approximately 6 mm in size corresponding to the spiculated mass seen mammographically.
	
	In the more central breast in the area of pleomorphic calcifications seen mammographically there is a mass measuring 1.6 cm at the 3 to 4 o'clock position 4 cm from the nipple.  There is also an adjacent smaller satellite nodule with possible calcifications as well.  Extending from this lesion there appear to be pleomorphic calcifications in a ductal distribution extending anteriorly towards the nipple and additional 3 cm anteriorly.  These findings are worrisome for ductal extension of tumor.
	
	No other lesions are identified within the breast parenchyma.  The right breast appears unremarkable.
	
	There is a lymph node in the left axilla which has a thickened cortex.  Metastatic disease cannot be completely excluded.
	
	One of the left breast masses as well as the prominent left axillary lymph node could be sampled with needle biopsy using ultrasound guidance
	
	These findings were discussed with the patient.  The patient was referred to our nurse navigator
	
	IMPRESSION:
	
	Highly suspicious mass with an adjacent satellite nodule corresponding to the palpable abnormality.
	
	Lesion in the left lateral breast approximately 3 cm from the palpable lump with pleomorphic calcifications which is also highly suspicious.  Extending from this lesion there appear to be pleomorphic calcifications in a ductal distribution extending anteriorly towards the nipple an additional 3 cm anteriorly.  These findings are worrisome for ductal extension of tumor.
	
	The multiple lesions in the left breast are likely of the same process and are highly suspicious.  Ultrasound-guided core biopsy of at least one or potentially to of these lesions is recommended to obtain tissue pathology
	
	Prominent left axillary lymph node with increased cortical thickening.  Further evaluation with tissue sampling of this lymph node is also recommended.

HISTORY:  Palpable mass in the left upper outer quadrant.  Family history of breast cancer.



COMPARISON: Mammograms of [DATE], [DATE], [DATE], [DATE], and [DATE].  Mammogram and ultrasound dated [DATE].



Breast Density: The breast parenchyma is heterogeneously dense which limits the sensitivity of mammography.



FINDINGS: 



2D digital mammography with 3D tomosynthesis was performed.  A marker lies on the skin surface at the left upper outer quadrant where the patient is symptomatic.  There is a poorly defined focal asymmetry about 2.2 cm diameter that is new or significantly larger since the older exam.  With spot compression, it persists, although the margins remain quite indistinct.  No frank architectural distortion or suspicious microcalcification is seen.  Mammograms are otherwise stable.



The sonogram of the left breast shows a complex, primarily solid mass about 3.2 cm diameter that corresponds to the palpable abnormality.  This lies at the 12 o'clock position 4 cm from the nipple.  The solid components show relatively hyperemic blood flow within.  Margins are lobulated and in some segments appear rather angular.  No acoustic shadowing is seen, however.  Benign-appearing cysts were seen in the same vicinity [DATE], but the solid component appears new.  Another hypoechoic solid nodule in the retroareolar left breast is about 0.5 cm diameter.  This is of rounded and better circumscribed appearance, and again does not show frank spiculation or acoustic shadowing.  Some mild ductal ectasia is seen in the retroareolar space bilaterally.  There is no adenopathy.  The sonogram is otherwise unremarkable.



IMPRESSION:



1.	Enlarging focal asymmetry in the left upper outer quadrant on mammogram, with a new complex mass on ultrasound, exceeding 3 cm maximal diameter.  This is worrisome for neoplasm and tissue diagnosis is recommended.  It would be amenable to ultrasound-guided core biopsy.  We would be pleased to provide this service on request.



2.	The retroareolar left breast also shows a second subcentimeter solid nodule that is relatively well circumscribed and probably benign, although tissue diagnosis may also be considered here, given the suspicious findings located more posteriorly in the same breast.

FINDINGS: 



2D digital mammography with 3D breast tomosynthesis was performed.  Previously seen indeterminate calcifications in the right upper central breast have significantly increased and these are now diffusely present throughout the upper outer quadrant, extending to the medial and lower breast. These are also in the region of palpable abnormality in the right upper outer quadrant. No suspicious abnormality is seen in the left lower inner quadrant in the other area of palpable abnormality.



Complete bilateral breast ultrasound was obtained, evaluating all four quadrants, the retroareolar region and axilla. Color and doppler imaging was also used on focal lesions.



In the region of palpable abnormality in the right breast at 9:00, there is an irregular hypoechoic mass with associated calcifications measuring approximately 3.3 x 2.5 x 2.8 cm. No abnormal right axillary adenopathy is seen. No definite focal sonographic abnormality is seen in the left breast at 6:00 in the region of palpable abnormality. There are a few tiny cysts bilaterally.

ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]



HISTORY:  Patient had a workup in [ADDRESS], [ADDRESS].  She was given the diagnosis of right breast cancer, but has no documentation.



COMPARISON: None



Breast Density: The breast parenchyma is heterogeneously dense which limits the sensitivity of mammography.



FINDINGS: 



2D digital mammography with 3D tomosynthesis was performed.  There is equivocal architectural distortion at the 12 o'clock position in the right breast which remains equivocal on the 3-D spot images.  Elsewhere, there are scattered benign calcifications.  Otherwise,   I see no dominant mass, skin thickening, nipple retraction, or pathologic grouped microcalcifications elsewhere in either breast.  There are few benign-appearing bilateral axillary lymph nodes.



Complete bilateral breast ultrasound was obtained, evaluating all four quadrants, the retroareolar region and axilla. Color and doppler imaging was also used on focal lesions.



Left breast ultrasound:     I see no cyst, mass, or focal abnormality by ultrasound.  



Right breast ultrasound: There is a hypoechoic shadowing, lobulated heterogeneous mass in the right breast at 12 o'clock 1 to 2 cm from the nipple highly suspicious for malignancy.  Ultrasound-guided core biopsy is recommended for confirmation.



I've spoken to the patient who appears to understand.  She will be introduced to one of our Nurse Navigators so as to most expeditiously schedule the biopsy.



IMPRESSION:



Ultrasound-guided core biopsy right breast mass at 12 o'clock is recommended.



ASSESSMENT: BIRADS: 5 - Highly suggestive of malignancy - appropriate action should be taken. 



RECOMMENDATION: 

1: Needle biopsy Right

	Breast Density: The breast parenchyma is heterogeneously dense which may obscure small masses.
	
	FINDINGS: 
	
	2D digital mammography with 3D breast tomosynthesis was performed.  There is developing distortion and focal asymmetry in the posterior third of the upper outer quadrant of the right breast beneath the skin marker indicating the surgical scar.  A few faint calcifications are noted in the region as well.  Multiple new circumscribed partially obscured isodense nodules are noted in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast as well.  No suspicious grouping of calcifications is seen.
	
	Complete right breast ultrasound was obtained, evaluating all four quadrants, the retroareolar region and axilla. Color and doppler imaging was also used on focal lesions.  In the 10 o'clock position of the right breast, 2 cm from the nipple, along the medial margin of the surgical scar, there is an irregular hypoechoic mass with echogenic reflectors.  The mass measures at least 2 x 1.4 cm.  Slightly more medially in the 12 o'clock position of the right breast, 1 cm from the nipple, there is a complex cystic nodule with thin septations as well as anechoic and hypoechoic components.  It measures approximately 1.6 cm.  In the right axilla, there is one lymph node which is not enlarged but does contain a focal bulge centrally.
	
	IMPRESSION:
	
	There is a suspicious mass in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast at the 10 o'clock position.  Ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy is recommended.
	
	There is an indeterminate complex cystic lesion in the 12 o'clock position of the right breast.  Again, ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy is recommended to exclude malignancy.
	
	There is an abnormal lymph node in the right axilla with a focal bulge.  Ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy is recommended.

COMPARISON: [DATE] and [DATE]



Breast Density: The breast parenchyma is heterogeneously dense which may obscure small masses.



FINDINGS: 



2D digital mammography with 3D breast tomosynthesis was performed.  There are 2 adjacent areas of distortion in the middle to posterior third of the upper slightly inner left breast.  No suspicious grouping of calcifications is identified within either breast.



Targeted ultrasound of the the right breast in the area of palpable concern at the 10 o'clock position demonstrates normal breast parenchyma.  Similarly, ultrasound of the area of palpable concern in the medial left breast at the approximate 8 o'clock position demonstrates normal breast parenchyma.  Incidental note is made of a cluster of microcysts in the 8 o'clock position, 6 cm from the nipple.



Ultrasound of the upper left breast and left axilla was performed as well.  In the 10 o'clock position, 4 cm from the nipple, there is an irregular hypoechoic lesion measuring 1.1 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm.  An adjacent smaller irregular hypoechoic lesion is noted in the 11 o'clock position, 5 cm from the nipple.  It measures 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.5 cm.  No enlarged left axillary lymph nodes are identified.



IMPRESSION:



There are 2 suspicious lesion located in the 10 o'clock and 11 o'clock positions of the left breast.  Ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy of both of these lesions is recommended.

Informed consent was freely given. A medial to lateral approach was selected. The marker clips that were placed under MR guidance yesterday were readily localized using a fenestrated compression paddle. Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion. Local anesthesia was administered with 1% lidocaine. The more anterior marker clip was targeted first. This dumbbell shaped clip lies slightly lateral to the most anterior of the enhancing nodules in the left upper inner quadrant that were seen on prior MR, having migrated by the accordion effect when compression was released after the MR procedure. A cm Kopans needle was advanced to the clip under mammographic guidance and deployed without incident once the needle tip position was confirmed in orthogonal projections. The cylindrical clip in the deep left upper inner quadrant was then targeted. This lies about cm lateral to the most posterior of the enhancing nodules in the left upper inner quadrant, also showing some lateral migration after the placement due to accordion effect when compression was released. A cm Kopans needle was advanced under mammographic guidance until it lay between the marker clip and target nodule medial to the clip. A Kopans hook wire was placed without incident. Under sterile conditions, mCi of technetium-99m sulfur colloid was injected intradermally and subcutaneously in the periareolar left breast, dividing the dose into injection sites to bracket the nipple on all sides. The patient tolerated the procedure well and suffered no immediate complications. The targeted lesions were marked on printed film copies of the mammograms, to accompany the patient to preop.

EXAM: BILATERAL 2D DIAGNOSTIC DIGITAL MAMMOGRAPHY WITH 3D 
TOMOSYNTHESIS AND COMPLETE RIGHT BREAST ULTRASOUND
ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]
 
HISTORY:  Palpable lump in the right upper outer quadrant.
 
COMPARISON: None
 
Breast Density: The breast parenchyma is heterogeneously dense which 
limits the sensitivity of mammography.
 
FINDINGS: 
 
2D digital mammography with 3D tomosynthesis was performed.  
Extensive bilateral microcalcifications in a pattern most consistent 
with sclerosing adenosis.  There is a spiculated mass in the 
retroareolar right upper outer quadrant at about the 9:30 position.  
There is nipple retraction and skin thickening.  Otherwise,   I see 
no dominant mass, skin thickening, nipple retraction, or pathologic 
grouped microcalcifications elsewhere in either breast.  Normal 
bilateral axillary lymph nodes.
 
Complete right breast ultrasound was obtained, evaluating all four 
quadrants, the retroareolar region and axilla. Color and doppler 
imaging was also used on focal lesions.  There is a retroareolar 
hypoechoic, heterogeneous mass measuring 1.3 x 2.8 x 3.0 cm in size 
that corresponds with the finding on mammography.  It has posterior 
acoustic shadowing.  There is a satellite lesion at the 9 o'clock 
position 2 cm from the nipple.  This measures 1.3 cm in size.  Normal 
axillary lymph nodes.  
 
IMPRESSION:
 
Probably malignant findings.  Recommend ultrasound-guided core biopsy 
of the retroareolar mass.
 
I've spoken to the patient who appears to understand.  She will be 
introduced to one of our Nurse Navigators so as to most expeditiously 
schedule the biopsy.
 
ASSESSMENT: BIRADS: 5 - Highly suggestive of malignancy - appropriate 
action should be taken.

There is a spiculated mass in the 9 to 10 o'clock position of the right breast.  It appears to have increased in size compared to the previous exam.;  However, measurement is difficult due to obscuration of the margins by the surrounding dense tissue.  Pleomorphic calcifications are noted along the posterior margin of the mass.  There is a microclip along the anterior margin of the mass related to the previous biopsy.  Linear density extends from the mass to the nipple which is newly retracted.  There is also a spiculated mass medially in the upper inner quadrant of the right breast.  There is skin thickening, particularly inferiorly; however, this has slightly decreased compared to the previous exam.  



In the left breast, a microclip is noted in the upper outer quadrant.  No suspicious mass, grouping of calcifications or area of nonsurgical architectural distortion is seen.  Mildly prominent axillary lymph nodes are noted.



Complete bilateral breast ultrasound was obtained, evaluating all four quadrants, the retroareolar region and axilla. Color and doppler imaging was also used on focal lesions.



In the left breast,  Only normal breast parenchyma is seen.  No cystic or solid mass lesion or area of acoustic shadowing is identified. No enlarged axillary lymph nodes are seen.



In the right breast, there is an ill-defined hypoechoic mass extending from the nipple posteriorly throughout the upper outer quadrant.  Measurement is difficult; however, it measures at least 5 cm but is likely larger.  In the 2 to 3 o'clock position of the right breast, there is an irregular hypoechoic nodule measuring 1 x 0.8 cm which is concerning for a satellite lesion.  No enlarged right axillary lymph nodes are seen.  There are a few nonenlarged lymph nodes within cortices.



IMPRESSION:



There is a mass occupying the majority of the upper outer quadrant of the right breast representing the biopsy-proven malignancy.  It has increased in size compared to the previous exam and there is new overlying nipple retraction.  A satellite nodule is noted in the upper inner quadrant of the right breast as well.  The patient is scheduled for repeat biopsy of the mass today.  Please refer to that report.



There is thickening of the skin of the right breast.  Dermal lymphatic invasion cannot be excluded.  Reportedly the patient had a skin punch biopsy.  Clinical correlation is recommended.



No mammographic or sonographic evidence of malignancy is identified within the left breast.

The area was anesthetized locally using cc of 1% lidocaine. A skin incision was made superior through which a 9-gauge vacuum assisted biopsy device was deployed. After the needle position was confirmed, multiple specimens were obtained. The specimen radiograph confirmed the presence of targeted calcifications. At the end of the procedure, a microclip was deployed at the biopsy site. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complication. The specimens were labeled and sent to [ADDRESS] for analysis. Postprocedure mammographic views of the right breast confirmed the presence of the microclip in the expected location.

	2D digital mammography with 3D breast tomosynthesis was performed.  Centrally within the left breast, there is an irregular mass with associated pleomorphic calcifications.  The overlying nipple is retracted.  The calcifications extend posteriorly from the mass into the upper outer quadrant.  When the mass and calcifications are included, the area of involvement measures 8 cm (craniocaudal) by 4.7 cm (AP) by 10.2 cm (transverse).  When only the mass is measured, the area of involvement measures 5.2 x 3.6 x 5.7 cm.  In the left axilla, there are 2 adjacent lymph nodes with thickened cortices.  Within the right breast, no suspicious mass, grouping of calcifications or area of nonsurgical architectural distortion is identified.  Vascular consultations are noted.  
	
	Complete left breast ultrasound was obtained, evaluating all four quadrants, the retroareolar region and axilla. Color and doppler imaging was also used on focal lesions.  In the upper outer quadrant of the left breast extending from 1 o'clock to 3 o'clock, there is an irregular hypoechoic mass measuring 4 x 2.9 x 4.1 cm.  The mass extends to and abuts the nipple which is retracted.  The mass contains a few echogenic foci corresponding to the calcifications on the mammogram.  2.5 cm medial to the mass is a similar appearing smaller hypoechoic lesion measuring 1.2 x 1 x 0.7 cm.  This is concerning for a satellite lesion.  Within the left axilla, there are 2 enlarged lymph nodes with thickened cortices.  The larger lymph node measures 1.9 x 1.4 x 1.5 cm while the slightly smaller lymph node measures 1.2 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm.
	
	Complete right breast ultrasound was obtained, evaluating all four quadrants, the retroareolar region and axilla. Color and doppler imaging was also used on focal lesions.  Only normal breast parenchyma is seen.  No cystic or solid mass lesion or area of acoustic shadowing is identified. No enlarged axillary lymph nodes are seen.
	
	IMPRESSION:
	
	There is a mass centrally within the left breast which is suspicious for a primary breast malignancy.  The mass abuts the nipple which is retracted.  Pleomorphic calcifications extend from the mass into the upper outer quadrant of the left breast.  In addition, there is a probable satellite lesion in the upper inner quadrant of the left breast.  The findings are concerning for multicentric disease.  Ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy of the dominant mass and probable satellite lesion in the 11 o'clock position is recommended.
	
	There are abnormal appearing left axillary lymph nodes.  The appearance is concerning for metastatic disease.  Ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy of a representative lymph node is recommended.

Informed consent was freely given. Lengthy real-time sonographic examination by the technologist and radiologist confirmed the presence of the more superficial mm nodule in the to o'clock position of left breast cm from the nipple, but failed to demonstrate the more indistinct mm nodularity that lay deeper in the same area on the prior ultrasound. This is suspected to have been a specular artifact appearing where multiple Cooper's ligaments and lobulations of fatty tissue overlap. A lateral to medial approach was selected. The mm target mass was readily localized. Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion. Local anesthesia was administered using 1% lidocaine. A ga. Bard core gun was placed adjacent to the target mass and a total of core specimens were retrieved under continuous sonographic guidance. These were placed in formalin for pathologic analysis. An MR-compatible ribbon-shaped Bard marker clip was then deployed through the guide needle in the usual manner. Hemostasis was achieved with direct manual compression. The patient tolerated the procedure well and suffered no immediate complications. A diagnostic mammogram obtained after the procedure showed the marker clip in the inferior left breast, at the 6-6:30 o'clock position near the junction of the anterior and middle zones. This corresponds well to the location of the nodule that was visible on pre-biopsy mammograms, but on the postbiopsy mammogram there is some anesthetic or hematoma in the vicinity that obscures fine details. The patient was released with standard postbiopsy care instructions after a brief period of observation and will follow up with Dr. [NAME]. IMPRESSION: Successful ultrasound-guided biopsy of a solid mm mass in the inferior left breast. A marker clip was left at the site. The previous sonogram showed a vague mass-like area of hypoechogenicity about mm diameter deep to the mm nodule that underwent biopsy today. However, detailed examination of this area by both the technologist and radiologist failed to show any corresponding abnormality today, and no target for biopsy could be identified in this vicinity. It is believed that the hypoechogenicity seen previously is an artifact of the heterogeneous overlapping tissue planes nearby. Short interval follow-up will be advisable after the workup of the biopsy site is complete. An addendum to this report will be generated when biopsy results are received.,EXAM: PATHOLOGY ADDENDUM ACCESSION: [ID], [ID] PATHOLOGY OUTCOME SECTION: Malignant PATHOLOGY RESULT SECTION: Ultrasound-guided core biopsy results have now been received from [ADDRESS].

ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]



HISTORY:  Palpable mass in the deep right upper outer quadrant.



COMPARISON: [DATE] and [DATE]



Breast Density: The breast parenchyma is heterogeneously dense which limits the sensitivity of mammography.



FINDINGS: 



2D digital mammography with 3D tomosynthesis was performed.  A marker lies on the skin surface at the deep right upper outer quadrant where the patient is symptomatic.  Subjacent to this, there is a new mass with rather angular borders that measures about 3.6 cm maximal diameter.  No other new or growing mass is seen.  There is no nonsurgical architectural distortion or suspicious microcalcification.



Sonography of the right breast was directed at the palpable abnormality lying in the 10 o'clock position 8 cm from the nipple.  This confirms the presence of a hypoechoic solid mass with rather hyperemic internal blood flow and markedly irregular margins.  No definite acoustic shadowing is seen but the appearance is quite suspicious for a primary breast carcinoma.  Maximal diameter is about 3.1 x 2.5 x 1.6 cm.  Long axis is parallel to the skin surface, but this does not outweigh the other potentially malignant features, and tissue diagnosis is recommended.



IMPRESSION:



3.1 cm solid mass in the 10 o'clock position of right breast 8 cm from the nipple.  This corresponds to the new palpable abnormality and is highly suspicious for a new primary breast carcinoma.  Tissue diagnosis is recommended.  It is amenable to ultrasound-guided core biopsy, and we would be pleased to offer this service if requested.



ASSESSMENT: BIRADS: 5 - Highly suggestive of malignancy - appropriate action should be taken.

HISTORY:  Left breast lump



COMPARISON: None, baseline



Breast Density: The breast parenchyma is composed of scattered fibroglandular densities.



FINDINGS: 



2D digital mammography with 3D tomosynthesis was performed.  There are suspicious pleomorphic calcifications throughout the left outer breast in the upper outer and lower outer quadrant as well as in the left retroareolar region and lower inner quadrant.  There is a 1.6 cm nodular density in the left lower central breast.  No abnormality is seen in the right breast.



Complete left breast ultrasound was obtained, evaluating all four quadrants, the retroareolar region and axilla. Color and doppler imaging was also used on focal lesions.



In the left breast at 5 o'clock, there is a 1.5 cm hypoechoic solid nodule, probably corresponding to the density seen mammographically.  At 3 o'clock, there is a 2.2 cm irregular hypoechoic region with associated echogenic foci, consistent with calcifications seen mammographically.  No abnormal left axillary adenopathy is identified.



IMPRESSION:



Suspicious hypoechoic lesions in the left breast at 5 and 3 o'clock, concerning for malignancy.  Ultrasound guided biopsy is recommended.  There are also abnormal calcifications throughout the left outer breast and left lower inner quadrant concerning for DCIS.  Findings were discussed with the patient at the time of interpretation.

The area was anesthetized locally using cc of 1% lidocaine. A skin incision was made laterally through which an introducer was placed. After the position was confirmed, multiple specimens were obtained using a 9-gauge vacuum assisted biopsy device. At the end of the procedure, a microclip was deployed at the biopsy site. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complication. The specimens were labeled and sent to [ADDRESS] for analysis. Postprocedure mammographic views of the right breast confirm the presence of the microclip in the expected location.

HISTORY:  [AGE]-year-old woman presents for evaluation of a palpable lump along the medial right breast.



COMPARISON: [DATE]



Breast Density: The breast parenchyma is heterogeneously dense which may obscure small masses.



FINDINGS: 



2D digital mammography with 3D breast tomosynthesis was performed.  In the medial right breast in the area of palpable concern, there is an irregular mass with associated pleomorphic calcifications.  Diffuse skin thickening and trabecular coarsening of the right breast are noted as well.  In the left breast, no suspicious mass, grouping of calcifications or area of nonsurgical architectural distortion is seen.  Overlying left axilla, there is a nodule which likely represents a lymph node.  A pacemaker is noted as well.



Complete bilateral breast ultrasound was obtained, evaluating all four quadrants, the retroareolar region and axilla. Color and doppler imaging was also used on focal lesions. 



In the area of palpable concern in the 3 o'clock position of the right breast, 8 cm from the nipple, there is an irregular hypoechoic mass measuring 2.3 x 1.4 x 1.7 cm.  Skin thickening is noted in the right breast, predominantly inferiorly where it measures up to 0.4 cm.  In the right axilla, there are multiple enlarged lymph nodes with thickened cortices.  A representative lymph node measures 1 x 1.8 cm.



In the left breast,  Only normal breast parenchyma is seen.  No cystic or solid mass lesion or area of acoustic shadowing is identified.  A few nonenlarged left axillary lymph nodes are seen.



IMPRESSION:



There is mass in the 3 o'clock position of the right breast which is suspicious for primary breast malignancy.  Ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy is recommended.



There are enlarged right axillary lymph nodes.  Metastatic disease cannot be excluded.  Ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy is recommended.



There is diffuse skin thickening involving the right breast.  It is uncertain if this represents edema from a lymphatic obstruction in this patient with axillary lymphadenopathy or dermal lymphatic invasion of tumor.  A skin punch biopsy should be considered.



No mammographic evidence of malignancy is identified within the left breast.



These results and recommendations were discussed with the patient at the time of the exam.  She will meet with our nurse navigator who will facilitate contacting the doctor's office.

	FINDINGS: 
	
	2D digital mammography with 3D breast tomosynthesis was performed.  A marker lies on the skin surface at the site of palpable abnormality of the approximate 10 o'clock position of right breast at middle depth.  Subjacent to the marker, there is a very poorly defined focal asymmetry that appears to have developed since the prior exam.  Maximal diameter approaches 4.5.  Some spiculation and distortion are suspected, especially on the tomographic imaging.  No other new or growing mass is seen.  There are benign-appearing punctate calcifications scattered bilaterally, but no suspicious clusters of microcalcification.
	
	Complete bilateral breast ultrasound survey was performed, encompassing all 4 quadrants, nipples, and axillae bilaterally.  In the 9 to 10 o'clock position of right breast, 3 cm from the nipple, there is a new hypoechoic solid mass about 4.1 cm maximal diameter.  There is some mild central acoustic shadowing.  Margins are quite irregular and angular.  This correlates well with the palpable abnormality and with the indistinct focal asymmetry on the mammogram.  Both breasts show a number of benign simple cysts, similar to those seen in [DATE], but no other solid mass is appreciated.  No adenopathy is depicted.

ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]



HISTORY:  Palpable mass in the upper left breast



COMPARISON: None at present.  Reportedly, outside studies from [DATE] or [DATE] exist elsewhere.



Breast Density: The breast parenchyma is heterogeneously dense which limits the sensitivity of mammography.



FINDINGS: 



2D digital mammography with 3D tomosynthesis was performed.  A marker lies on the skin surface at the 12:00 middle position of left breast where the palpable abnormality is felt.  Subjacent to this, there is a rather prominent area of ill-defined focal asymmetry and architectural distortion, measuring approximately 7 cm overall diameter, without a discrete border-forming mass.  Pronounced architectural distortion persists on the tomographic images.  No other mass, nonsurgical architectural distortion, or suspicious microcalcification is seen elsewhere on either side.  Skin and nipples are grossly normal appearance.



Sonography of the left breast, with particular attention to the palpable abnormality, shows a solid mass with angular borders of at least 2.7 cm maximal diameter in the 11:30-12 o'clock position 7 cm from the nipple.  It shows dense acoustic shadowing.  A second hypoechoic lesion with acoustic shadowing and angular margins is seen in the 11 o'clock position 4 cm from the nipple, approximately 1.8 cm maximal diameter.  These 2 sites are about 2 cm apart and it is unclear if there is any direct connection.  No adenopathy is noted.



IMPRESSION:



Large focal asymmetry with persistent architectural distortion in the upper central left breast.  Ultrasound shows 2 particularly suspicious ill-defined areas of hypoechoic tissue with angular margins in the vicinity of the palpable abnormality, presumably a dominant mass with a satellite lesion.  Tissue diagnosis is recommended.  It would be amenable to ultrasound-guided core biopsy and we would be pleased to provide this service upon request.



ASSESSMENT: BIRADS: 5 - Highly suggestive of malignancy - appropriate action should be taken.

1: Needle biopsy Left

Breast Density: The breast parenchyma is heterogeneously dense which may obscure small masses.



FINDINGS: 



2D digital mammography with 3D breast tomosynthesis was performed.  In the posterior third of the medial right breast, there is new nodular asymmetry which is best seen on the 3-D images.  In the upper outer quadrant of the the right breast, there is a grouping of pleomorphic calcifications which is also new.  It measures 0.8 cm as it extends linearly.  The additional new calcifications in the lower inner quadrant of the the right breast are coarse and rim like.  They have a similar appearance to the calcifications in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast.  These calcifications have a benign appearance suggestive of evolving dystrophic calcification.



Ultrasound of the medial left breast was performed.  In the 1 to 2 o'clock position, 4 cm from the nipple, there is a lobulated hypoechoic nodule measuring 0.8 x 0.4 x 0.6 cm.  This accounts for the new nodule noted on the mammogram.  In the 5 o'clock position right breast, 4 cm from the nipple, there are 2 adjacent anechoic nodules measuring 0.3 cm.  These nodules do not demonstrate posterior acoustic enhancement, suggestive of fat necrosis.



IMPRESSION:



There are indeterminate calcifications in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast.  Stereotactic guided core needle biopsy is recommended to exclude malignancy.



There is an indeterminate nodule in the 1 to 2 o'clock position of the right breast.  Ultrasound guided core needle biopsy is recommended to exclude malignancy.

Informed consent was freely given. A lateral to medial approach was selected. The poorly defined hypoechoic tissue in the to o'clock position of the anterior left breast was readily localized. Overlying skin was prepped in sterile fashion. Local anesthesia was administered using 1% lidocaine. A ga. Bard Marquis core gun was placed adjacent to the target lesion. core specimens were retrieved under continuous sonographic guidance. These were placed in formalin for pathologic analysis. An MR-compatible ribbon-shaped Bard marker clip was then deployed through the guide needle in the usual manner. Bleeding was relatively prolonged but hemostasis was achieved with direct manual compression. Using similar technique, the dominant left axillary lymph node was then targeted for biopsy using a 16-gauge Bard Marquis core gun. specimens were obtained and placed in a separate formalin vial. An MR-compatible, sonographically-visible Twirl marker device was then deployed in the node under sonographic guidance. Again, there was somewhat prolonged bleeding but hemostasis was achieved with manual compression.

	COMPARISON: Mammogram of [DATE].
	
	Breast Density: The breast parenchyma is heterogeneously dense which may obscure small masses.
	
	FINDINGS: 
	
	2D digital mammography with 3D breast tomosynthesis was performed.  Positioning on the left is limited by a pacemaker generator in the chest wall.  No discrete border-forming mass is seen on the mammogram, but there is some increasing architectural distortion in the lateral right breast, especially the upper outer quadrant, that corresponds to the area of palpable abnormality pointed out by the patient.  Scattered calcifications in the right breast are not substantially changed.  Most of the calcifications in the left breast are also stable.  However, there are developing clusters of punctate microcalcifications in the lower inner quadrant and lower outer quadrant at middle depth that do not show dependent layering.  The likelihood of malignancy is low but not zero.
	
	Sonography of the right breast also shows no well-defined mass, but there is a suspicious area of heterogeneous hypoechoic shadowing tissue between the 8:00 and 10:00 positions, centered 6 to 7 cm posterior to the nipple.  Overall diameter is at least 3.5 cm and the indistinct margins have an irregularly distorted/spiculated appearance.  The findings are potentially due to a poorly defined infiltrating primary breast carcinoma, especially a lobular carcinoma.
	
	IMPRESSION:
	
	1.	The right upper outer and lower outer quadrant show architectural distortion and very ill-defined shadowing hypoechoic tissue that corresponds to the area of new palpable abnormality.  This is quite suspicious for an infiltrating neoplastic lesion, particularly a lobular carcinoma.  Tissue diagnosis is recommended.  It is amenable to ultrasound-guided biopsy and we would be pleased to offer this service if requested.
	
	2.	Developing microcalcifications in the left lower outer quadrant and left lower inner quadrant are much less suspicious, but potentially due to atypia or early malignancy.  Given the advanced age of the patient and the likelihood that she will have poor tolerance for stereotactic biopsy, final disposition of these calcifications should be deferred until the results of the right breast biopsy are in hand.  At that point, it may be appropriate to perform either an excisional surgical biopsy or a mastectomy on the left, in addition to a right mastectomy.  A stereotactic biopsy could also be attempted at that time if clinically indicated.

	COMPARISON: Mammograms of [DATE], [DATE], [DATE], [DATE], [DATE] and [DATE].  Sonogram of right breast dated [DATE].  Bilateral breast ultrasound of [DATE].
	
	Breast Density: The breast parenchyma is heterogeneously dense which may obscure small masses.
	
	FINDINGS: 
	
	2D digital mammography with 3D breast tomosynthesis was performed.  There are 2 markers on the skin surface at the right upper outer quadrant.  The more anterior marker, lying close to patient's previous surgical scar, shows no significant underlying abnormality.  The more posterior marker lies adjacent to a rather spiculated appearing mass of about 1.8 cm that is apparently new since [DATE].  Elsewhere in both breasts, there is no other new or growing mass, nonsurgical architectural distortion, or suspicious microcalcification.  Many scattered benign calcific densities are stable.
	
	Sonography directed at the right upper outer quadrant shows surgical scar and a few tiny cysts in the vicinity of the more anterior palpable lesion, at the 10 o'clock position 6 cm from the nipple.  No discrete mass is seen in the vicinity.  At the more posterior palpable abnormality, in the 10 o'clock position of right breast 10 cm from the nipple, there is a hypoechoic spiculated mass with some mild central acoustic shadowing.  This lesion measures about 1.7 cm maximal diameter and appears to be the same as the hypoechoic mass of about 1.3 cm that was seen in [DATE], at which time of biopsy was recommended.  (The patient states that she never returned for biopsy.)  There is no adenopathy.
	
	IMPRESSION:
	
	1.	The more posterior of the 2 palpable masses in the right upper outer quadrant corresponds to a 1.7 cm spiculated, shadowing mass of rather suspicious appearance, showing slow growth since [DATE].  Again, tissue diagnosis is strongly recommended.  It is amenable to ultrasound-guided core biopsy and we would be pleased to provide this service upon request.

	HISTORY:  Palpable mass in left upper outer quadrant.
	
	COMPARISON: Nothing contributory.
	
	Breast Density: The breast parenchyma is heterogeneously dense which may obscure small masses.
	
	FINDINGS: 
	
	2D digital mammography with 3D breast tomosynthesis was performed.  In the upper outer quadrant of left breast at middle to anterior depth, there is a rather poorly defined and somewhat spiculated mass of approximately 3 cm maximal diameter. This correlates well with the palpable abnormality and is of concern for neoplasm. It contains some rather coarse, nonspecific calcific densities. Elsewhere in both breasts, no other discrete mass is seen, except that there is a rather prominent left axillary lymph node that is partially visible on the oblique view. No other suspicious microcalcifications or areas of architectural distortion are noted.
	
	Sonography of the palpable mass in the left upper outer quadrant shows a hypoechoic, solid, spiculated lesion approximately 2.9 x 1.9 x 2.6 cm diameter. The appearance is very worrisome for neoplasm. It is centered in the 1 to 2 o'clock position of left breast 1 cm from the nipple. In the left axilla there is a moderately enlarged lymph node about 2.5 x 1.4 x 2.1 cm diameter. The cortex is markedly thickened, almost effacing the fatty hilum. This is worrisome for metastasis. No locally invasive disease is seen at the site.
	
	IMPRESSION:
	
	1.	Spiculated 3 cm solid mass in the left upper outer quadrant, highly suspicious for malignancy.
	
	2.	Enlarged left axillary lymph node with effacement of the normal fatty hilum. This is quite suspicious for nodal metastasis from the suspected primary carcinoma in the same breast.
	
	3.	Tissue diagnosis from both sites is advised. They are amenable to ultrasound-guided core biopsy and we would be pleased to provide this service if requested.

The Kopans hook wire was deployed through the needle in the usual manner without incident, with the hook lying at the deep inferior/medial aspect of the target mass, and the mass surrounding the thick collar of the Kopans wire. A diagnostic mammogram obtained after the procedure showed the hook wire at the middle to deep right upper outer quadrant close to the posterior nipple line. The target mass is obscured by surrounding dense breast tissue. The collar and hook of the Kopans wire are positioned just inferior to previous biopsy marker clips, and numerous microcalcifications lie in between the markers just above the Kopans wire. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was released to preop in stable condition. Film copies of these images were printed and marked for intraoperative guidance. An addendum to this report will be generated when specimen radiographs and surgical pathology reports are received.

Accession number was SO20-02826. A specimen radiograph following lumpectomy showed the microcalcifications and biopsy marker clips that lay close to the target nodule. The mass itself was obscured by surrounding dense breast tissue. Pathology specimen A is the primary lumpectomy specimen. It contains invasive ductal carcinoma with associated microcalcifications, of Nottingham histologic grade Maximal diameter of the tumor was cm, concordant with the sonographic images of the target lesion. Margins were negative for carcinoma, although it came within mm of the posterior and inferior margins. Estrogen and progesterone receptors were both positive. There was a radial scar and proliferative fibrocystic change with associated microcalcifications. Specimen B is additional tissue from the lateral margin of surgical excision. No residual carcinoma is seen. Margins are negative. There are proliferative fibrocystic changes with associated microcalcifications. Imaging and pathology findings are concordant. Both mammographic and sonographic follow-up would be advised for postlumpectomy imaging follow-up, at least initially. RECOMMENDATION: 1: Treatment plan Right,"

Left breast appears stable and benign.
	
	Ultrasound was therefore performed and fails to reveal a convincing mass or persistent shadowing sonographically.

There are benign appearing calcifications.  There is a subtle distortion in the upper right breast, therefore ultrasound will be performed to evaluate further.  No suspicious mass, calcifications, or area of architectural distortion is seen in the left breast.  Targeted right breast ultrasound demonstrates a 17 mm distorted mixed echogenic region at the 12 to 1 o'clock position, likely corresponding to the area of distortion on mammogram.

EXAM: BILATERAL 2D DIAGNOSTIC DIGITAL MAMMOGRAPHY WITH 3D 
TOMOSYNTHESIS AND COMPLETE BILATERAL BREAST ULTRASOUND
ACCESSION: [ID]
 
HISTORY:  [AGE]-year-old woman presents for further evaluation of the 
left breast.  On her MRI of the abdomen dated [DATE], enhancing 
masses were noted in the left breast.  The patient states that she 
now feels a lump in the area.
 
COMPARISON: MRI of the abdomen dated [DATE]
 
Breast Density: The breast parenchyma is heterogeneously dense which 
limits the sensitivity of mammography.
 
FINDINGS: 
 
2D digital mammography with 3D tomosynthesis was performed.  In the 
retroareolar region of the left breast, there is a spiculated mass 
with associated pleomorphic calcifications.  The overlying nipple is 
retracted.  More laterally in the upper outer quadrant of the left 
breast at the approximate 2-3 o'clock position, there is a 
pleomorphic grouping of calcifications encompassing an area measuring 
1.1 cm.  In the upper inner quadrant of the left breast at the 
approximate 10 o'clock position, there is a 0.9 cm nodule with 
associated coarse calcifications.  There is nodular asymmetry in the 
inferior right breast which does not persist on the spot images.  No 
suspicious grouping of right breast calcifications is seen.
 
Complete left breast ultrasound was obtained, evaluating all four 
quadrants, the retroareolar region and axilla. Color and doppler 
imaging was also used on focal lesions.  In the 3 o'clock 
retroareolar region of the left breast, there is an irregular 
hypoechoic mass abutting the nipple.  It measures 1.8 x 1.3 x 1.8 cm.  
Slightly more laterally in the 3 o'clock position left breast, 2 cm 
from the nipple, there is a second irregular hypoechoic mass 
measuring 1.8 x 1.3 x 1.8 cm.  This is in the area of the pleomorphic 
calcifications noted on the mammogram.  There is a third lesion in 
the 10:30 position of the left breast, 3 cm from the nipple.  It 
measures 0.5 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm.  This likely corresponds to the partly 
calcified nodule noted on the mammogram.  No enlarged left axillary 
lymph nodes are seen.
 
Targeted ultrasound of the inferior right breast was performed.  Only 
normal breast parenchyma is seen.  No cystic or solid mass lesion or 
area of acoustic shadowing is identified in the right breast.     
 
IMPRESSION:
 
There are 3 suspicious masses in the left breast located at the 3 
o'clock retroareolar region, 3 o'clock position 2 cm from the nipple 
and 10:30 position, 3 cm from the nipple.  Ultrasound-guided core 
needle biopsy of all 3 sites is recommended to exclude malignancy.
 
These results and recommendations were discussed with the patient at 
the time of the exam.  Our nurse navigator will followup with the 
patient.

HISTORY:  [AGE]-year-old woman who had a right lumpectomy in [DATE] presents for annual mammography with no new breast related complaints.  She is been followed in the past for breast asymmetries and left breast density.



COMPARISON: [DATE], [DATE], [DATE]



Breast Density: The breast parenchyma is heterogeneously dense which limits the sensitivity of mammography.



FINDINGS: 



2D digital mammography with 3D tomosynthesis was performed.  The distortion at the lumpectomy site in the upper inner quadrant of the right breast is unchanged.  Nodule in the lower inner quadrant of the left breast has slightly increased in size.  Coarse benign-appearing calcifications are noted in the outer right breast.  No suspicious mass, grouping of microcalcifications or area of nonsurgical architectural distortion is seen.



Complete bilateral breast ultrasound was obtained, evaluating all four quadrants, the retroareolar region and axilla. Color and doppler imaging was also used on focal lesions.  In the 8 o'clock position of the right breast, 4 cm from the nipple, there is an ill-defined shadowing hypoechoic lesion measuring 0.9 x 0.7 cm.  In the 9 o'clock position of the left breast, 2 cm from the nipple, there is an anechoic circumscribed nodule which has increased in size measuring 1.1 x 0.5 cm compared with 0.6 x 0.4 cm previously.  This simple cyst accounts for the enlarging mammographically detected nodule.  Otherwise,  Only normal breast parenchyma is seen.  No suspicious cystic or solid mass lesion or area of acoustic shadowing is identified. No enlarged axillary lymph nodes are seen.



IMPRESSION:



No mammographic evidence of malignancy is identified within the left breast.



There is an indeterminate hypoechoic lesion in the 8 o'clock position of the right breast.  While this could represent shadowing from [NAME]'s ligament or fibrosis, ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy is recommended to exclude malignancy.



These results and recommendations were discussed with the patient at the time of the exam.  She will meet with our nurse navigator who will facilitate contacting the doctor's office.

HISTORY:  Right breast lump and pain



COMPARISON: None



Breast Density: The breast parenchyma is heterogeneously dense which limits the sensitivity of mammography.



FINDINGS: 



2D digital mammography with 3D tomosynthesis was performed.  There is a focal asymmetry with suspicious pleomorphic calcifications in the right upper outer quadrant measuring up to approximately 4 cm.  The calcifications extend towards the nipple.  There are a few benign-appearing calcifications in the left breast.



Complete bilateral breast ultrasound was obtained, evaluating all four quadrants, the retroareolar region and axilla. Color and doppler imaging was also used on focal lesions.



There is a suspicious hypoechoic solid mass in the right breast at 10-11 o'clock in the region of palpable abnormality.  This measures up to 4.8 cm and corresponds to the lesion seen mammographically.  No other suspicious lesion is seen bilaterally.  Abnormal right axillary lymph nodes with thickened cortices are seen measuring up to 1.2 cm.  There is a vague hypoechoic region in the left breast at 1-2 o'clock, probably due to asymmetric tissue.  There is a 5 mm superficial nodule in the left breast at 9 o'clock in the retroareolar region and another 4 mm nodule at 10-11 o'clock.



IMPRESSION:



Suspicious mass with pleomorphic calcifications in the right upper outer quadrant in the region of palpable abnormality and abnormal right axillary adenopathy.

In the 8 o'clock position of the right breast, 4 cm from the nipple, there is an ill-defined shadowing hypoechoic lesion measuring 0.9 x 0.7 cm.  In the 9 o'clock position of the left breast, 2 cm from the nipple, there is an anechoic circumscribed nodule which has increased in size measuring 1.1 x 0.5 cm compared with 0.6 x 0.4 cm previously.  This simple cyst accounts for the enlarging mammographically detected nodule.  Otherwise,  Only normal breast parenchyma is seen.  No suspicious cystic or solid mass lesion or area of acoustic shadowing is identified. No enlarged axillary lymph nodes are seen.



IMPRESSION:



No mammographic evidence of malignancy is identified within the left breast.



There is an indeterminate hypoechoic lesion in the 8 o'clock position of the right breast.  While this could represent shadowing from [NAME]'s ligament or fibrosis, ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy is recommended to exclude malignancy.

HISTORY:  The patient has a history of adenoid cystic carcinoma resected in [DATE].  Follow-up breast MR in [DATE] showed a 1.2 cm focus of enhancement in the surgical bed at the retroareolar lower inner quadrant of left breast, indeterminate for scar versus residual/recurrent malignancy.



COMPARISON: Postoperative breast MR [DATE].  Mammogram and ultrasound from [DATE], prior to surgery.



Breast Density: The breast parenchyma is heterogeneously dense which may obscure small masses.



FINDINGS: 



2D digital mammography with 3D breast tomosynthesis was performed.  Since the older mammograms, the dominant retroareolar mass has been resected.  Today's exam shows a much smaller nodularity in the 6-7 o'clock position of anterior left lower inner quadrant adjacent to the surgical scar, approximately 1.7 cm diameter, with partially obscured margins.  No frank spiculation or nonsurgical architectural distortion is seen.  There are no suspicious microcalcifications.  No other new or growing mass is noted.



Sonography of the left breast shows a 1.4 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm lobulated hypoechoic solid mass in the 6 o'clock position of left breast 3 cm from the nipple, apparently corresponding to the nodularity on mammogram.  It lies very close to the surgical scar, which has a more linear appearance and extends up to the skin surface.  It does not show any acoustic shadowing, but the margins are rather microlobulated and angular.  No other significant sonographic abnormality is seen on either side.



IMPRESSION:



Hypoechoic solid mass in the left lower inner quadrant at the 6 to 7 o'clock position 3 cm from the nipple, measuring about 1.4 cm maximal diameter on ultrasound.  This finding probably correlates with the masses on mammogram and MRI.  It could represent residual/recurrent malignancy in the surgical bed.  Tissue diagnosis would be advised for definitive evaluation.  It would be amenable to ultrasound-guided core biopsy, and we will be pleased to provide this service if requested.

The patient had an interval excision, but the scar marker is along the marker clip outer right breast in the prior excision site was reported as 6 o'clock position.  This distortion and increased density along 12 o'clock right breast therefore does not confidently have a postsurgical explanation.  There is scattered nodular asymmetry elsewhere bilaterally, otherwise unchanged.  Few loosely scattered calcifications unchanged.
	
	Complete bilateral breast ultrasound was obtained, evaluating all four quadrants, the retroareolar region and axilla. Color and doppler imaging was also used on focal lesions.  There is a lobulated solid mass at the 12 o'clock position right breast measuring 1.4 cm diameter, with some eccentric Doppler flow within.  This is not confidently scar morphologically, and biopsy would be recommended in a elevated risk patient to exclude malignancy.

	ACCESSION: [ID], [ID]
	
	HISTORY:  Remote history of right breast cancer.  Recent diagnosis of malignancy in left lower outer quadrant, receiving neoadjuvant treatment.
	
	COMPARISON: Mammograms of [DATE], [DATE], [DATE] and [DATE].  Ultrasound of left breast and bilateral breast MR dated [DATE].  The most recent previous sonogram of the right breast dates to [DATE].
	
	Breast Density: The breast parenchyma is composed of scattered fibroglandular densities.
	
	FINDINGS: 
	
	2D digital mammography with 3D breast tomosynthesis was performed.  A triangular focal asymmetry in the left lower outer quadrant is about 1.1 cm diameter.  On the mammogram from [DATE] it was described as being 7 mm, but to my remeasurement there has been no substantial interim change.  Distortion nearby is probably related to overlying surgical scar and has not changed appreciably since [DATE].  No new or growing mass is seen on either side.  Postoperative changes of the inferior right breast and in the right axillary tail are stable.  There is a large, coarse, benign calcification in the right axilla that may reflect old granulomatous disease or treated neoplasm in an axillary node.  A few other benign calcific densities in both breasts are stable.
	
	Sonography of the right breast shows a 0.7 cm seroma subjacent to the scar at the 6 o'clock position.  In [DATE] it was about 0.8 cm.  No specific evidence of locally recurrent disease is seen.  Dense shadowing in the right axillary tail corresponds to the large benign calcification seen on mammogram.  There is no other significant mass, shadowing, nonsurgical distortion, or other significant interim change.
	
	IMPRESSION:
	
	1.	Triangular focal asymmetry in the left lower outer quadrant is not significantly changed.  This is probably better evaluated on the sonogram and MR from [DATE], however.
	
	2.	Likely surgical scar and other benign findings elsewhere in both breasts, appearing stable since prior year studies.
